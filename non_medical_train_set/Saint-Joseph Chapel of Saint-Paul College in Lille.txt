The Saint-Joseph Chapel was a historic church on the grounds of Saint-Paul College in Lille, France. It was built in 1887, and was demolished in February 2021 to build a new campus.

Construction
The chapel was the work of architect Auguste Mourcou.

Demolition
The demolition was criticised and described an "iniquitous act" by journalist St√©phane Bern, and attempted to be prevented by former Minister of Culture Franck Riester.
