2010 TSA procedures protest
At the Seattle Airport in November, 2010, a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) airport screening device identified her prosthesis for a missing breast. As a result, cancer survivor Cissna was subjected to a particularly humiliating and intrusive body search. Rep. Cissna was faced again with the invasive procedure on February 21, 2011 when being screened in Seattle for a return to Anchorage. She refused to be subjected to such an indignity once more and returned to Alaska by boat and taxicab. Her experience received national publicity, questioning the methods which TSA forces upon those least likely to be security threats. Similarly, Kentucky U.S. Senator Rand Paul missed a flight after he refused to undergo a pat down after an anomaly was spotted during a TSA body scan.

2012 congressional election
On April 11, 2012, Cissna announced that she would become a candidate to run against 19-term Alaska Republican Congressman Don Young, the United States House of Representatives sponsor of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that created the TSA in 2001.  Cissna won her five-person primary with 50% of the Democratic vote. She vowed to make resistance against useless and unnecessary humiliation by the TSA part of her campaign.On November 6, 2012, Cissna lost the Congressional race to incumbent Don Young, 63.94% to 28.61%.

Personal life
Cissna lives in Anchorage, Alaska and was widowed twice and is currently married. She has one daughter named Robin.
