Plus is now part of the Millennium Mathematics Project, a long term national initiative based in Cambridge and active across the UK and internationally.
Authors of articles in Plus include Stephen Hawking and Marcus du Sautoy.Plus won the 2001 Webby for Best Science Site on the Web, and has been described as "an excellent site put together by those with a real love for the subject". In 2006 the Millennium Mathematics Project, of which Plus is a part, won the  Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher Education.
