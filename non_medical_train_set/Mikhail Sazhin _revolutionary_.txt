Mikhail Petrovich Sazhin (1845–1934), also known by the pseudonym Armand Ross, was a Russian revolutionary and anarchist.He was politically active as a student in the 1860s, and was exiled to Volgoda in 1868 for his actions. He escaped to the United States in summer 1869, then went to Geneva, where there was a significant Russian émigré population, in mid-1870. There he met with, among others, Vladimir Serebrennikov, Sergey Nechayev, and Mikhail Bakunin. He was particularly impressed by Bakunin. He then left for Britain. At the end of the summer he returned to Switzerland, this time to Zürich, this time going by the name "Armand Ross". He organized a community of Russian revolutionaries, creating a reading circle and a library for the purposes of raising the political consciousness of Russian students in Zürich, whom he had found to be overly absorbed in science. Membership was restricted to people with similar political views.
