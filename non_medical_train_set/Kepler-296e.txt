Kepler-296e (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-1422.05) is a confirmed Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of Kepler-296. The planet was discovered by NASA's Kepler spacecraft using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured. NASA announced the discovery of the exoplanet on 26 February 2014.

Confirmed exoplanet
Kepler-296e is a super-Earth with a radius 1.75 times that of Earth. The planet orbits Kepler-296 once every 34.1 days.

Habitability
The planet was announced as being located within the habitable zone of Kepler-296. In this region, liquid water could exist on the surface of the planet. As of 2017, with an ESI of 0.85, it is the fifth-most Earth-like planet after Kepler-438b, TRAPPIST-1 d, and two Gliese-designated planets,  GJ 3323 b      and  GJ 273 b, which were both discovered in 2017.
