The Annunciation (Hungarian: Angyali üdvözlet) is a Hungarian film directed by András Jeles in 1984,  based on The Tragedy of Man (1861) by Imre Madách.

Plot summary
When Adam (Péter Bocsor) and Eve (Júlia Mérő), having succumbed to Lucifer's temptation, are cast out of the Garden of Eden, Adam holds Lucifer (Eszter Gyalog) to his promise, reminding him that "You said I would know everything!". So Lucifer grants Adam a dream of the world to come. In the dream, Adam becomes Djoser in Egypt; Miltiades in Athens; a wealthy Roman during the time of Jesus Christ; a knight called Tancred in Byzantium; Johannes Kepler in Prague; Danton in revolutionary Paris; and a nameless suitor in Victorian London. Guided by a deceptively sweet but ultimately contemptuous Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of the horror of the human story involving rape, betrayal, savagery, mindless cruelty and fanaticism.
