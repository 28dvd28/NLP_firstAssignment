During his lifetime Atherton became one of the most wealthiest and influential businessmen on the Hawaiian Islands, primarily interested in sugar cane, he later became active in a number of corporations and enterprises.Castle & Cooke during his tenure, was one of the Big Five (Hawaii), known in Hawaiian as Nā Hui Nui ʻElima. These sugarcane processing corporations wielded considerable political power in the Territory of Hawaii and leaned heavily towards the Hawaii Republican Party.

Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy
Atherton was a member of the Committee of Safety (Hawaii), formally the Citizen's Committee of Public Safety. The Committee  was composed of mostly Hawaiian subjects and American citizens who were members of the  Missionary Party, as well as foreign residents in the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi that planned and carried out the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi on January 17, 1893.  The new independent Republic of Hawaii government was thwarted in this goal by the administration of President Grover Cleveland, and it was not until 1898 that the United States Congress approved a joint resolution of annexation creating the Territory of Hawaii. In 1901 he traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet President Theodore Roosevelt, as part of a committee including Francis Mills Swanzy (managing director of Theo H. Davies & Co.), and William Owen Smith to discuss the needs of Hawaii; specifically use of  Chinese labor and the arrival of automobiles.
