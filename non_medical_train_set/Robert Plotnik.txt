Robert Edward Plotnik (August 28, 1943 â€“ November 29, 2018), also known as Bleecker Bob, was the owner of an eponymous record shop first located on Bleecker Street in Manhattan, New York. He became a legend in the music industry and his store was a landmark in Greenwich Village, known for its selection of rare records. Often viewed as eccentric, he formed friendships with many celebrities. Members from bands like Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, David Bowie and the Clash would frequent his shop looking for old records.Plotnik was noted for recognizing changes in music, and his store was at the forefront of emerging rock genres, such as punk rock, where he offered hard-to-find British and American records. Joey Ramone of the punk rock band the Ramones, said, "Bleecker Bob's has everything." This often required him to import records from overseas that were not available in the United States. Many rock stars were patrons of his shop, and Plotnik would often jeer them while in his store. Guitarist Lenny Kaye met Patti Smith while he was working for Plotnik at Village Oldies.
The wisecracking Plotnik and his shop were featured on a 1993 episode of Seinfeld, titled "The Old Man".
