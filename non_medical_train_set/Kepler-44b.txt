Planetary system
The Kepler spacecraft detected a transiting planet candidate around this star that was confirmed by radial velocity measurements taken by the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.93 m telescope at the Haute-Provence Observatory.
The planet is likely to be tidally locked to the parent star. In 2015, the planetary nightside temperature was estimated to be equal to 2347+149−280 K.
