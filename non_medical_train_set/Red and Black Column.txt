The Red and Black Column was the fifth militia column organized by the CNT-FAI in Barcelona to send to the Aragon front. Its incorporation took place in mid-September, in the Province of Huesca as a reinforcement to the anarchist Ascaso and Harriers columns.
According to Alberto Bayo, the contingent formed with "militiamen from the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, a century of foreigners, young people from Estat Català, from the National Confederation of Labor, from the Republican Left of Catalonia, Acció Catalana and the Iberian Anarchist Federation".
