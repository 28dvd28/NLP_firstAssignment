Pietro Gori (August 1, 1865â€“January 8, 1911) was an Italian lawyer, journalist, intellectual and anarchist poet. He is known for his political activities, and as author of some of the most famous anarchist songs of the late 19th century, including Addio a Lugano ("Farewell to Lugano"), Stornelli d'esilio ("Exile Songs"), Ballata per Sante Caserio ("Ballad for Sante Caserio"), Inno del Primo Maggio ("May, 1 Anthem"). In 1898 he immigrated to Argentina where he contributed to the development of the anarchists' influence in the labor movement, specifically in the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation.
