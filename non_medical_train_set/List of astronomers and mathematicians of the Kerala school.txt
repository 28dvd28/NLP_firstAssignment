The region surrounding the south-west coast of the Indian subcontinent, now politically organised as the Kerala State in India, has a long tradition of studies and investigations in all areas related to the branch of śāstra known as jyotiṣa. This branch of śāstra, in its broadest sense, incorporates several subdisciplines like mathematics, astronomy, astrology, horary astrology, etc. In Indian traditional jyotiṣa scholarship, there are no clear cut boundary lines separating these subdisciplines. Hence the list presented below includes all who would be called a jyotiṣa-scholar in the Indian traditional sense. All these persons will be, most likely, well versed in the subdisciplines of mathematics and astronomy as well. The list is an adaptation of the list of mathematicians and astronomers compiled  by K. V. Sarma.  Sarma has referred to all of them as astronomers. K. V. Sarma (1919–2005) was an Indian historian of science, particularly the astronomy and mathematics of the Kerala school. He was responsible for bringing to light several of the achievements of the Kerala school. He was editor of the Vishveshvaranand Indological Research Series, and published the critical edition of several source works in Sanskrit, including the Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata. He was recognised as "the greatest authority on Kerala's astronomical tradition".
Additional information about the persons mentioned in the list are available in books on the history of Malayalam literature and on the history of Sanskrit literature in Kerala.
