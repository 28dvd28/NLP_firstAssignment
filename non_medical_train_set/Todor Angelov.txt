Todor Angelov Dzekov (Bulgarian: Тодор Ангелов Дзеков, rendered in French as Théodore Angheloff; 12 January 1900 – 30 November 1943) was a Bulgarian anarcho-communist activist who lived in exile in Belgium for much of his adult life. He served in the Bulgarian Dimitrov Battalion during the Spanish Civil War and, during the German occupation of Belgium, was a leader within the Partisans Armés as part of the Belgian Resistance. He was captured and executed in 1943.
In Belgium, Angelov was an active supporter of the Communist Party of Belgium. In 1942, he organized a resistance group, the "Corps Mobile de Bruxelles", under the auspices of the "Partisans Armés" and associated with the "Front de l'Indépendance", the major Belgian underground movement.
