Saint-Pierre de Chaillot (French pronunciation: [sɛ̃.pjɛʁ də ʃa.jo]) is a Roman Catholic parish church in the Chaillot neighborhood of the 16th arrondissement of Paris, at 31, avenue Marceau. It is constructed in the "Romano-Byzantine" style.

History
The parish of Saint-Pierre de Chaillot dates back to the 11th century. The historic church of the parish was entered from rue de Chaillot, with only a chapel with a brick facade opening onto avenue Marceau. That church hosted the funerals of Guy de Maupassant on 8 July 1893 and of Marcel Proust on 21 November 1922, but all that now survives of it is a statue of the Virgin Mary, the 'Vierge de Chaillot'. The present building (architect:Emile Bois) was started in 1933 and completed in 1938. Henri Bouchard was the sculptor and Nichals Untersteller the painter of the interior frescoes. Pierre Seguin sculpted the column capitals. The Maumejan brothers did the stained glass windows and also made the mosaic behind the altar in the crypt. Pierre Ducos de la Haille did the ceiling frescoes in the dome of the sanctuary as well as the frescoes in the crypt consisting of Christ, the Holy Spirit, and Saint Peter.
