Léon-Jules Léauthier (1874–1894) was a French anarchist who, on 12 November 1893,  went to a restaurant in Paris specifically to kill anyone he thought was part of the bourgeoisie. His random victim turned out to be the Serbian ambassador to France, Serge Georgevitch, who survived the attack. Léauthier admitted his guilt and told the authorities that had not known that his victim was an ambassador when he stabbed him. He was sentenced to the Salvation Islands penal colony of Cayenne, French Guiana, where he died within a year during a prisoner revolt.
