MEI (Mathematics in Education and Industry) is an independent educational charity and curriculum development body for mathematics education in the United Kingdom. Income generated through its work is used to support the teaching and learning of mathematics.

History
MEI was founded in 1963 with a grant from the Schools & Industry Committee of the Mathematical Association. In 1965 it produced its first exam, Additional Mathematics, then produced an A level course two years later. MEI's A-level exams were the first to include probability.
It was incorporated as a company on 18 October 1996.
