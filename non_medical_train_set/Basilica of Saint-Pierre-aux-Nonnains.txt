The basilica of Saint-Pierre-aux-Nonnains in Metz, France, is one of the oldest churches in Europe. The building began life in the 4th century when Metz was an important Gallo-Roman city.

History
The building belonged to one of several thermae (public baths complexes) which existed in Metz in Roman times. Some sources describe it as having been a gymnasium. In the 7th century, the structure was converted into a church, becoming the chapel of a Benedictine nunnery. A new nave was constructed in the 11th century with further interior renovations. 
In the 16th century Metz was besieged by the troops of Charles V and later was converted into an important garrison town by the French. The building became a warehouse, and remained so after being declared a historical monument in 1909.  In the 1970s it was restored and opened for concerts and exhibitions.
