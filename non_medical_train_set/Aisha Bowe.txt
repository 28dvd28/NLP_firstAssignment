Early life and education
Bowe grew up in the United States in a working-class family. Although her high school guidance counselor recommended that she become a cosmetologist, Bowe's father encouraged her to take a mathematics class at her local community college. This foundation in mathematics then allowed Bowe to transfer into engineering programs at the University of Michigan from Washtenaw Community College.Bowe completed her undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering in 2008, and master's degree in space systems engineering in 2009, both at the University of Michigan. She has said she chose aerospace engineering because of an interest in science fiction. One of her graduate professor, Thomas Zurbuchen, was a mentor and inspiration to Bowe to pursue a career at NASA.

Career
Bowe worked in the Ames Research Center, in the Flight Trajectory Dynamics and Controls Branch of the Aviation Systems Division. She joined the AST Flight and Fluid Mechanics group in 2009, assisting in the development and of algorithms in support of Air Traffic Management. In 2012 she received the National Society of Black Engineers award for Outstanding Technical Contribution for her paper "Evaluation of a Fuel Efficient Aircraft Maneuver for Conflict Resolution".  As a Bahamian-American, Bowe wants "to see more Bahamians in the science and technology field."While at NASA, she served as liaison to the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Program. In this role, she mentored students, held interview workshops and led NASA site tours.Bowe is a part of the U.S State Department Speaker Program and has delivered lectures in South Africa, Israel and Kuwait.Bowe will travel with Blue Origin in 2024 on the New Shepard launch vehicle making her the first black woman to travel with Blue Origin.Bowe is a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and a certified Program Management Professional by PMI. She is also a certified SSI scuba diver and a mountain climber.

STEMBoard
Bowe is a co-founder and CEO of STEMBoard, a company that provides professional advisory services to organizations in the U.S Government. The company was founded in 2013 and is an SBA 8(a) Certified Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB) supported by the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce.STEMBoard was ranked on Inc.

LINGO
Bowe founded LINGO, an education technology company in 2022. The company makes projects-based activities for kids. The activities are available in the form of kits including coding kit that teaches hardware and software design. The lessons are self-paced. The first kit was called "In the Driver’s Seat" which taught kids to create and code a back-up sensor for an autonomous car. The company provides kits to children in over 10 countries.
