Fazio Cardano (1444 â€“ 28 August 1524) was an Italian jurist and mathematician.  He was a student of perspective.  Cardano was also a professor at the University of Pavia, and was devoted to hermetical science and the world of the occult.  He was a friend of Leonardo da Vinci.
It was said that Cardano was always in the company of a familiar spirit who talked to him.  This may be a rumour originating from a habit of speaking to himself.Fazio Cardano was the father of Gerolamo Cardano.
