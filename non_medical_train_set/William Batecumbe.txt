Batecumbe was at the University of Oxford, where he was magister.

Works
Batecumbe produced a 1348 edition of the Alphonsine tables. Tabula mediorum motuum Planetarum in annis collectis et expansis, composita a magistro Batecombe, a manuscript preserved in the library of Magdalen College, Oxford, and a manuscript listed a formerly belonging to John Dee and named "Tabulæ Latitudinum secundum Bachecombe", are taken to be derived works.De Sphæræ concavæ fabrica et usu, a copy of which was seen by John Bale in the library of Robert Recorde, and De Sphæra solida, are late attributions.
