Denis Auroux (born April 1977 in Lyon) is a French mathematician working in geometry and topology.

Education and career
Auroux was admitted in 1993 to the École normale supérieure. In 1994, he received a licentiate and maîtrise in mathematics from Paris Diderot University (Paris 7). In 1995, he received a licentiate in physics from Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris 6) and passed the agrégation. In 1995, he received a master's degree in mathematics from Paris-Sud University with a thesis on Seiberg-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds. In 1999, he received his doctorate from the École polytechnique with supervisors Jean-Pierre Bourguignon and Mikhael Gromov for a thesis on structure theorems for compact symplectic manifolds via almost-complex techniques. In 2003, he completed his habilitation at Paris-Sud University with a thesis on approximately holomorphic techniques and monodromy invariants in symplectic topology. 
As a postdoc, he was a C. L. E. Moore Instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1999 to 2002, where he became an assistant professor in 2002, an associate professor in 2004 (tenured in 2006), and a professor in 2009 (on leave from 2009 to 2011). From 2009 to 2018, he was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Since Fall 2018, he has been at Harvard University, where he taught Math 55, two-semester honors undergraduate course on algebra and analysis.His research deals with symplectic geometry, low-dimensional topology, and mirror symmetry.In 2002, he received the Prix Peccot from the Collège de France. In 2005, he received a Sloan Research Fellowship. He was an invited speaker in 2010 with talk Fukaya Categories and bordered Heegaard-Floer Homology at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad and in 2004 at the European Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm.
