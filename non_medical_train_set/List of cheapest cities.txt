Economist Intelligence Unit
The Economist Intelligence Unit has analyzed the prices of more than 160 products and services in each city. The survey has been done considering the base city as New York, which has an index set at 100. Based on the survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit there are slight changes in the ranking of the cheapest cities in the world as compared to last year's report. One city from Pakistan and three major cities from India all are in the top ten cheapest cities in 2020. The main reason behind this is the low wages and high levels of income inequality, which restrict household expenses, as well as market competition.The ten cheapest cities in the world 2020.
