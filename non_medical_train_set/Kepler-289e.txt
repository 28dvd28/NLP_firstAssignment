Kepler-289 (PH3) is a star slightly more massive than the Sun, with an unknown spectral type, 2300 light-years away from Earth in the Cygnus constellation. In 2014, three planets were discovered orbiting it.

Planetary system
Kepler-289 hosts four planets, three confirmed (Kepler-289b, Kepler-289c, Kepler-289d) and one unconfirmed candidate (Kepler-289e). The discovery of this system was made using the transit method. The inner three planets were found in 2014 with the Kepler space telescope and the Planet Hunters team, while planet e was discovered by follow-up studies in 2017. As of 2023, planet d's eccentricity is not yet known.
