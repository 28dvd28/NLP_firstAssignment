Architecture
The church has a modern design and is constructed of red brick. The original design called for a single, large building for the main church room, a small perpendicular wing for storage and offices and a simple church tower. The tower was free standing and separated from the main church buildings. In 1986 the adjoining wing was renovated and the flat roof was made into a saddle roof with trussed rafters. In 1990 the church received a new facade of red brick, the tower was capped with a copper roof and a porch was added to the main entrance. In 1997 the parish took over the cemetery from Aarhus Municipality and a new wing with offices was added, enclosing the church tower in a courtyard.
