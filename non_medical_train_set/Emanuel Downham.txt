Emanuel Ethelbert "E. E" Downham (March 23, 1839 – September 17, 1921) was an American businessman, miner, and mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, from 1887 to 1891, serving two terms. He was a prominent member of the Masonic Order in Virginia, and helped in the development and raising funds for the George Washington Masonic National Memorial. He died in 1921.

Family and Career
Early life
Downham was born March 23, 1839, in Newport, New Jersey, the son of Emanual Downham, and his wife Eleanor. He was orphaned at a young age and grew up in the care of his relatives, along with his younger sister. In his youth, he went west as a Fifty-Niner during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in the then Kansas Territory. He was among the earliest miners, and settlers in the area. He returned to New Jersey in 1861, and later moved to Alexandria, Virginia and started a liquor business.

Career
After moving to Alexandria in 1862, Downham decided not to directly join the war effort, and instead focused on the development of a liquor business. During the war, he sold liquor and other commodities to Union troops. In 1869, Downham was involved in a legal dispute with the city of Alexandria, which reached the Supreme Court and was decided in DOWNHAM v. ALEXANDRIA. This case became a legal precedent and is cited to the present day. 
Later in his career, he entered politics, and despite his previous poor relationship with the city council, he himself was elected to the council in 1874. Upon the death of mayor, John B. Smoot, in 1887, he was elected by the council to fill out his term. He was very popular amongst the population and was elected outright in 1890, serving with distinction until 1891, before retiring from public office.

Family
Downham married Sarah Miranda Price, daughter of a prominent merchant family, on November 16, 1865, and together they had 6 children, 5 of which lived into adulthood.
His son, Robert Forsythe Downham, bought the Lee–Fendall House in 1903. In 1914 the Downham family hosted President Woodrow Wilson for a reception. The house was kept in the Downham name until 1937. 
His son, Horace English Downham, along with his company, was involved with mining operations in Arizona, and Mexico in the late 1800s.

Death
Downham died on September 17, 1921, at the age of 82, and was buried in The Presbyterian Cemetery in Alexandria.
