The separate bell tower, which is 114 meters tall, was built in the 15th century. The tower can be visited every day from April to October.

Legend of the mummies
From the late eighteenth century until 1979, over 60 of the mummified bodies were exhibited in the crypt.In 1881 a Gallo-Roman cemetery and catacombs were discovered under the tower, with several naturally mummified bodies (see note). The church is a listed historical monument.
The mummies were found in 1791 according to other sources, in the adjacent parish graveyard which, having become full, was being cleared, with remains being transferred to catacombs; they further state that the bodies were removed to the cimetière de la Chartreuse in 1979.
