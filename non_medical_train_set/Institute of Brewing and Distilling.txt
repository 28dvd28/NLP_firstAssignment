History

In October 1906 a group of Yorkshire brewers established the Operative Brewers' Guild, which changed its name to the Brewers' Guild in 1929. The Guild and the Institute merged to form the Institute and Guild of Brewing (IGB) in 2001, which was later renamed as the Institute of Brewing and Distilling in 2005.
