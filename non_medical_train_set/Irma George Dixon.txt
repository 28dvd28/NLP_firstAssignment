Early life
Irma George was born on 1911 in Baltimore, Maryland, to Edward and Lillian George. She attended Baltimore public schools then Coppin Normal School before earning a B.S. in English at Morgan State College.

Dixon, who was an insurance broker and bail bondsman.

Political life

A Democrat, Dixon served from 1960 through re-election for the 1964 term, until her death in 1965 (she missed the final session because she was hospitalized).Dedicated to fighting for racial uplift, in 1962 Dixon sponsored a bill that proposed to ban racial discrimination in private employment throughout Maryland. She was also a committed Democrat, though, and in 1958 refused to join a coalition ticket of all African American candidates, choosing instead to support a straight Democratic ticket. She criticized the coalition as having "chosen their candidates solely on the basis of color, which in itself is an act of segregation in its worst form."A former teacher, she was a strong advocate for education in the legislature, proposing considering tax increase to pay for increased funding for education, as well as making schooling compulsory beginning in kindergarten. Of the latter policy, which became law, she said, "Today's truant is tomorrow's dropout."She was also an advocate of equal pay for men and women.As a legislator, she was known for keeping in touch with constituents by passing out self-addressed stamped postcards with the invitation to send her their concerns.During the 1964 United States presidential election, Dixon was a field representative for Democratic National Committee, traveling the East Coast to support voter registration.
