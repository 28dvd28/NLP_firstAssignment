Kepler-19c is an extra-solar planet orbiting the star Kepler-19 approximately 717 light years from Earth.

Discovery
The planet was discovered as a result of examinations of data from the previously discovered exoplanet, Kepler-19b.  Timing variations in the orbital period of the first planet necessitated  gravitational forces to be acting upon the planet, resulting from an additional body in the vicinity, acting to cause a variation of transition of five minutes per orbit. The lead author of the paper announcing the discovery was Sarah Ballard.
