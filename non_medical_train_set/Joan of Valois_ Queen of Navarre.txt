Joan of France, also known as Joan or Joanna of Valois (24 June 1343, Châteauneuf-sur-Loire – 3 November 1373, Évreux), was Queen of Navarre by marriage to Charles II of Navarre (called The Bad). She was the daughter of John II of France (called The Good), and Bonne of Luxembourg. She served as regent of Navarre during the absence of Charles II between 1369 and 1372.

Life
She was first betrothed to John of Brabant, son of John III, Duke of Brabant and his wife Marie d'Évreux. The marriage did not, however, take place.

Queen
Joan instead was married on 12 February 1352 to Charles the Bad, at Chateau du Vivier, close to Fontenay-Trésigny in Brie, Coutevroult. He was the son of Philip III of Navarre and his wife, Joan II of Navarre. Joan and Charles were agnatic third cousins and cognatic second cousins. Because of her age, she remained in France until 1360, when she was seventeen.
Her marriage was distant first, but Charles eventually developed confidence in her: he appointed her regent when he left for warfare in France in 1369, and she ruled successfully until his return in 1372, one year before her death.Joan died in 1373, aged thirty, in Évreux. She was buried in the Royal Abbey of Saint Denis.
