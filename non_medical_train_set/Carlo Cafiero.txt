Carlo Cafiero (September 1, 1846 – July 17, 1892) was an Italian anarchist, champion of Mikhail Bakunin during the second half of the 19th century and one of the main proponents of anarcho-communism and insurrectionary anarchism during the First International.Cafiero is noted for writing a concise but extraordinarily faithful summarized account of Karl Marx's Das Kapital. Among others, Marx himself, who had found other summaries errant, praised it. Marx also said that Cafiero's summary lacked a proper emphasis on "the material conditions necessary to the emancipation of the proletariat [which] are generated spontaneously by the development of capitalist exploitation." He encouraged Cafiero to revisit his summary in hopes that this aspect of Capital might better be accounted for.
