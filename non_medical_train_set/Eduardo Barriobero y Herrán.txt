Eduardo Barriobero y Herrán (1875 in La Rioja – 1939) was a lawyer and activist in the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo.
During the Spanish Civil War he became the presiding judge of the anarchists' "People's Tribunal" in Barcelona. He soon ran afoul of the Republican government, who accused him of embezzling some of the fines he collected.He was captured by the Francoists in 1939, and in his subsequent trial he denied being an anarchist, saying "I am not an anarchist. I am a radical anticlerical Freemason." However, his pleas did him no good, and he was executed by firing squad.
