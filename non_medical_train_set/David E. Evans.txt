David E. Evans FLSW was born in 1950 at Glanamman, Dyfed, Wales. He is a professor of mathematics at Cardiff University, specialising in knot theory. He has published a number of books, many in collaboration with Yasuyuki Kawahigashi. 
He studied at New College, Oxford, and Jesus College, Oxford.From 1975 to 1976 Evans worked as a scholar and research assistant in the department of theoretical physics at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. Over the next few years he travelled around the world working as a research fellow at UCLA (1977); Australian National University, Canberra (1982, 1989); Kyoto University (1982-83, 1985); and the University of Ottawa (1983). Between 1987 and 1998 he worked as a professor at Swansea, Wales. Since 1998, he has worked as a professor at Cardiff University.
