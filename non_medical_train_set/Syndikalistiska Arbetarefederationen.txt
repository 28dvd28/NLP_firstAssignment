Syndikalistiska Arbetarefederationen ('Syndicalist Workers Federation', SAF) was an anarcho-syndicalist trade union centre in Sweden 1928–1938. SAF was founded in 1928, as a splinter group from Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation (SAC). SAF published the weekly newspaper Arbetare-kuriren from Göteborg. SAF criticised SAC of centralism and bureaucracy. SAF consistently tried to keep its membership dues low, in order to attract low-paid workers. P. J. Welinder, who for a short time sat on the board of the IWW during his time as an immigrant to the US, was the ideological force in the union. Folke Fridell, the famous proletarian writer, was also a notable member.In 1928 SAF had around 1,000 members. By the mid-1930s, the number had grown to around 3,000.SAC took several initiatives towards a reunification with SAF. In 1938, SAF merged into SAC.
