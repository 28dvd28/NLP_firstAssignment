Benjamin Osgood Peirce (February 11, 1854 – January 14, 1914) was an American mathematician and a holder of the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard from 1888 until his death in 1914.

Early life
Benjamin Osgood Peirce was born to M. (née Seccomb) and Benjamin Osgood Peirce on February 11, 1854, in Beverly, Massachusetts. In 1876, he graduated from Harvard College. He then received a PhD from the Leipzig University in 1879. He then studied in Berlin, Germany for another year.

Career
Peirce taught at the Boston Latin School for one year. From 1881 to 1884, he taught mathematics at Harvard University. He then taught mathematics and physics as an assistant professor until 1888. In 1888, he became the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.Peirce was elected to the Council of the American Mathematical Society, serving from 1896 to 1898. He was a founder of the American Physical Society when it began in 1899 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (United States) in 1906. He was honoured with election to foreign academies such as the Mathematical Circle of Palermo and the French Physical Society. In 1910 he was awarded an honorary degree by Harvard University. In 1912 he represented Harvard University at the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Society of London.

Personal life
Peirce married Isabella Turnbull Landreth in 1882. Together, they had two daughters.Removed by several degrees, he was a cousin of Charles Sanders Peirce, whose father, Benjamin Peirce, worked as the academic advisor to Joseph Lovering, Benjamin Osgood Peirce's predecessor as holder of the Hollis Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.

Death
Peirce died at his home in Cambridge from angina on January 14, 1914. He is buried at the Central Cemetery in Beverly.
