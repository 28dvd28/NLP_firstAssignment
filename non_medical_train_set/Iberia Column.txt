It was organized in centuries that acted under the direction of a war committee, which included anarchists such as Vicente Sanchís, Modesto Mameli and José Padilla. It even came to have its own supply and health services, as well as a field hospital with 72 beds for the wounded.The column marched to the Teruel Front, where it remained for most of its existence.
