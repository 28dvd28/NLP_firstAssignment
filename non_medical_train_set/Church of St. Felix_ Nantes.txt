The Church of St. Felix (French: Église Saint-Félix) is a Roman Catholic church located in the district of Hauts-Pavés/Saint Felix, in Nantes, France. The church is dedicated to the fifth century French bishop, Felix of Nantes.

History
Before its creation, the current St. Felix parish was part of the village of Barbin, and it adjoined St. Similien parish.The church was built from August 1843 on the land bordering the château de la Haute-Forêt, with plans by architect Charles Raymond (1813–1872). In a Gothic Revival style and with a small scale. Once completed, the small rural church was extended and dedicated to Monsignor Jean-François de Hercé on 25 February 1844. At the time, the vault was not completely finished and the floor was not paved.
In 1856, the Ministry of Interior offers a memorial for Olivier Saint-Félix converting the Saxons, and added two wings to the nineteenth-century building. The church was enlarged again around 1950 and consecrated on 20 June 1953. All the windows are works of Gabriel Loire.

Organs
