Hugh (died 730) was the son of Duke Drogo of Champagne and his wife Anstrudis. He entered the church and became archbishop of Rouen in 722.

Life
Hugh was the grandson of Pepin of Heristal and Plectrude on his father's side, and of Waratton and Ansfledis on his mother's. Both Waratton and Drogo were mayors of the palaces. He was brought up by his grandmother Ansfled, while his father Drogo was duke in distant Champagne. Paul Fouracre regards the education of Hugh as an example of the important role of women in Frankish family fortunes and in politics generally.While still a layman, Hugh was endowed with Jumièges Abbey, which he entered as a monk in 718 under Abbot Cochin. He later became vicar-general of the diocese of Metz. In 722, Hugh was elected to the vacant archdiocese of Rouen. In 723, he accepted charge of Fontenelle Abbey. In 724, he took on the administration, together with his own, of the dioceses of Paris and Bayeux. He used the revenue from his various benefices to promote piety and learning.Towards the end of his life, Hugh retired to Jumièges, where he died on 9 April 730. He was interred at Jumièges. In the ninth century his relics were relocated to Belgium in order to save them from profanation at the hands of Vikings. He is regarded as a saint and his feast day is kept on 9 April.
