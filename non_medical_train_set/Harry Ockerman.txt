In 1951, Ockerman's second, and final, year coaching the MSNC Hurons, the press reported rumors that the football players had been "doped" with novocain to allow them to play through injuries. Joseph McCulloch, in his fourth decade as MSNC's athletic director, denied the allegation, telling reporters, "We want to know who started these rumors."

Late life and death
After retiring from coaching, Ockerman owned and operated a calendar and specialty advertising business in Baltimore. He died on September 30, 1979, at Boswell Hospital in Sun City, Arizona.
