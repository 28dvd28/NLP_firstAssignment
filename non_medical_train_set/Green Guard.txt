The Green Guard (Ukrainian: Зелена Гвардія) was an anarchist guerrilla unit in occupied Ukraine during World War II.

History
The Green Guard was formed in 1942 in the Kyiv Oblast, then part of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, by the former Makhnovist Osip Tsebriy, who had returned from exile in France, on the other end of Nazi-occupied Europe. Tsebriy tried to revive the tradition of the Makhnovschina among the Ukrainian peasants. The partisans fought against the troops of Nazi Germany, as well as those of the Soviet Union, and Ukrainian nationalists. In the winter of 1943, the Green Guard was crushed by anti-partisan German troops. Tsebriy went into hiding with the local peasants for several months, but in the end was captured. Unrecognized, he was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany, from where he was freed by the western Allies in 1945.
