Abu Sa'id al-Dharir al-Jurjani (ابو سعيد الضرير الجرجاني), also Gurgani, was a 9th-century Persian mathematician and astronomer from Gurgan, Iran.  He wrote a treatise on geometrical problems and another on the drawing of the meridian. George Sarton considers him a pupil of Ibn al-A'rabi, but Carl Brockelmann rejects this opinion.

Works
Two of his works are extant:

Masa'il Hindisia (a manuscript is available in Cairo)
Istikhraj khat nisf al-nahar min kitab analima wa al-borhan alayh (available in Cairo, translated by Carl Schoy)
