The Church of Saint Giles (Czech: Kostel svatého Jiljí) is a church in Prague, Czech Republic. This monumental three-aisled church was built on the foundations of a Romanesque church. Subsequently, numerous reconstructions took place during the 12th to 14th century. The Church of St. Giles in Prague was consecrated on 4 May 1371.
In 1625, the church was donated to the Dominican order, which has served here and in the adjacent monastery ever since. The church was remodeled in Baroque style.
