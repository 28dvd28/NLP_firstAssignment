Foundry Street in the Luckie Marietta district of Downtown Atlanta is named for Winship's foundry.
Winship had his mansion in the Inman Park neighborhood of Atlanta.
His daughter, Emily Carolyn Winship, would marry prominent businessman Ernest Woodruff. Winship's grandson, Robert Winship Woodruff, after whom Downtown Atlanta's Woodruff Park is named, would run the Coca-Cola company.
