Ivan Smith  is a British mathematician who deals with symplectic manifolds and their interaction with algebraic geometry, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics. He is a professor at the University of Cambridge.

Education and career
Smith was born in 1973 to Neil Smith, a professor of linguistics at University College London. Smith studied at the University of Oxford, where he received his doctorate in 1999 under the supervision of Simon Donaldson  with thesis Symplectic Geometry of Lefschetz Fibrations. Smith is now a professor in Cambridge at Gonville & Caius College.
Among other things, Smith derived nodal invariants from symplectic geometry.
He received in 2007 the Whitehead Prize for his work in symplectic topology (highlighting the breadth of applied techniques from algebraic geometry and topology) and in 2013 the Adams Prize. In 2018 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro.
Smith was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2023.
