History
On 15 July 2011 Church president Thomas S. Monson announced that a Latter-day Saint temple would be constructed in France. New temples are generally announced during a church general conference.  However, French newspapers reported the church's plans to build the temple at Le Chesnay, which prompted the early announcement, three months prior to the October 2011 conference.Local opposition included Mayor Philippe Brillault who opposed the temple—planned on a site for an abandoned, asbestos-choked power plant—and proclaimed, "We weren’t overjoyed, because Mormons have an image that’s pretty much negative."A public open house was held from 22 April 2017 to 13 May 2017, excluding Sundays. The temple was dedicated on 21 May 2017 by Henry B. Eyring.In 2020, the Paris France Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
