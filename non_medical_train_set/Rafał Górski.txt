At age 16, Górski participated in the fights of the 1989 Krakow May, where youth from ZOMO fought against the election campaign of Leszek Moczulski, who ran for a mandate from the list of the Confederation of Independent Poland in the contract elections. In 1989, Górski also took part in the protests in Warsaw against the election of Wojciech Jaruzelski as President of Poland and in Krakow in protests at the Soviet consulate. He later participated in ZSMP's and PZPR's occupation of the consulate in September 1989, and December 1989, respectively, and was involved in a series of street fights in Nowa Huta at the Lenin monument. In 1990, he supported the election campaigns of KPN members to the Krakow City Council, and participated in protests at the Soviet consulate against their aggression towards Lithuania in January 1991. He also took part in the Trail of the First Cadre Company March from Kraków to Kielce.In 1991, Górski joined Anarchist Federation (Krakow section), the Free Caucasus Committee and the Committee for the Assistance and Defense of Repressed Workers. Within these organizations, he helped co-organize a number of protests, including a blockade against the construction of Czorsztyn Dam), which resulted in a number of arrests.
In 1995, Górski was arrested and jailed for his role in the occupation of the Delegation of the Ministry of Privatization building in Krakow and for previous charges of resisting police during the Dam Tamie in Czorsztyn, in July 1992. Anarchists and members of KPN rallied in his defence, including MP Leszek Moczulski, who issued a surety for Górski. Górski was sentenced to a fine and was released following three weeks of hunger strike while being held in custody.On February 8, 2022, Górski was arrested on suspicion of attacking a police officer during an eviction blockade earlier in the year. Anarchist organizations criticized the arrest, claiming that his detention was an attempt by police to "silence the citizens". Górski had originally planned a demonstration for the following day. Once news of his arrest reached anarchist circles, anarchists across Poland carried out "Liberate Górski" campaigns, in an effort to draw attention to his "unfounded arrest". Górski was sentenced to eight months in prison, which was later commuted to two years of probation.
