History
The construction of St. Vardanants Martyrs Church in Yerablur began in 1994 on the initiative of Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin I and Vazgen Sargsyan. The sponsors of the construction of the church are the Armenian Americans Hrach and Victoria Voskanyan. The church was consecrated in 1998 by Archbishop Garegin Nersisyan.
Gradually, a community formed around the church, consisting of the parents of the killed Armenian and Artsakh soldiers, whose graves are buried in the Yerablur Military Pantheon. By order of the Catholicos of All Armenians in the church every Sunday on the Feast of Tabernacles, on the Days of the Dead, on the feasts of St. Vardanants and St. Sarkis, the sacred liturgy is celebrated.
