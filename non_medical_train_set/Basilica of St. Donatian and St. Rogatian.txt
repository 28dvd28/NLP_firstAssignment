History
Roman era
The church building stands on the site of an ancient Gallo-Roman villa. Excavations in 1873 brought to light an ancient pagan cemetery, a pit in the center of the apse containing 27 nails assigned to the coffins of the two martyrs and reveal that four church buildings were successively below the basilica.The promulgation of the Edict of Constantine, nine years after the death of the martyrs, sees developing a cult around the bodies of two brothers as martyrs, first dislocated on the rack, whipped and driven out of the city not far from the current basilica, at the No. 63 rue Dufour, where an executioner speared them in the throat and then beheaded them. According to tradition, their bodies are placed, 21 years after their death, in a gray marble sarcophagus, measuring 2.25 meters long and 75 centimeters wide. The relics then attract pilgrims, requiring the creation of a "guard of honor" consists of the monks of St. Martin. The parish was then considered by Nantais as a "holy land" .The first church was built in the tradition of family ownership of Nantes saints to 490.

Middle Ages
The Norman invasions destroyed the first building, but once peace returned, a new church building was built around the year 980. However, according Dubuisson-Aubenay, the primitive sanctuary remnants still exist in the 17th century, including an ancient apse.
