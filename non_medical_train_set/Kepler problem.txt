In classical mechanics, the Kepler problem is a special case of the two-body problem, in which the two bodies interact by a central force F that varies in strength as the inverse square of the distance r between them.  The force may be either attractive or repulsive.  The problem is to find the position or speed of the two bodies over time given their masses, positions, and velocities.  Using classical mechanics, the solution can be expressed as a Kepler orbit using six orbital elements.
The Kepler problem is named after Johannes Kepler, who proposed Kepler's laws of planetary motion (which are part of classical mechanics and solved the problem for the orbits of the planets) and investigated the types of forces that would result in orbits obeying those laws (called Kepler's inverse problem).For a discussion of the Kepler problem specific to radial orbits, see Radial trajectory. General relativity provides more accurate solutions to the two-body problem, especially in strong gravitational fields.

Applications
The Kepler problem arises in many contexts, some beyond the physics studied by Kepler himself.  The Kepler problem is important in celestial mechanics, since Newtonian gravity obeys an inverse square law.  Examples include a satellite moving about a planet, a planet about its sun, or two binary stars about each other.  The Kepler problem is also important in the motion of two charged particles, since Coulomb’s law of electrostatics also obeys an inverse square law.  Examples include the hydrogen atom, positronium and muonium, which have all played important roles as model systems for testing physical theories and measuring constants of nature.The Kepler problem and the simple harmonic oscillator problem are the two most fundamental problems in classical mechanics.  They are the only two problems that have closed orbits for every possible set of initial conditions, i.e., return to their starting point with the same velocity (Bertrand's theorem).  The Kepler problem has often been used to develop new methods in classical mechanics, such as Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, and action-angle coordinates.  The Kepler problem also conserves the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector, which has since been generalized to include other interactions.  The solution of the Kepler problem allowed scientists to show that planetary motion could be explained entirely by classical mechanics and Newton’s law of gravity; the scientific explanation of planetary motion played an important role in ushering in the Enlightenment.

Mathematical definition
The central force F between two objects varies in strength as the inverse square of the distance r between them:

  
    
      
        
          F
        
        =
        
          
            k
            
              r

              r
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {k}{r^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {r}} }
  where k is a constant and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              r
              ^
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }
   represents the unit vector along the line between them.  The force may be either attractive (k<0) or repulsive (k>0).  The corresponding scalar potential is:

  
    
      
        V
        (
        r
        )
        =
        
          
            k
            r
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V(r)={\frac {k}{r}}}

    {\displaystyle E=-{\frac {k^{2}m}{2L^{2}}}}
   for perfectly circular orbits (the central force exactly equals the centripetal force requirement, which determines the required angular velocity for a given circular radius).
For a repulsive force (k > 0) only e > 1 applies.
