Following graduation from the University of Sydney, Lake studied surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons in England in the early 1950s and went on to become the first Australian surgeon to specialise in hand surgery. He gave up his work as a surgeon in 1979 to concentrate on his interest in wine and food.

In 1963, Lake founded Lake's Folly, a winery in the Hunter Region in New South Wales considered to be Australia's first boutique winery and a major influence on the Australian wine industry. In 1988, The Bulletin magazine called Lake "the man who started the (Australian) wine boom".His wife and son, Stephen, were active in the winery. Stephen said that "Dad was the boss, Mum the brains and I was the brawn".In addition to making wine, Lake wrote widely on wine and food. In 1966, he published the landmark book Classic Wines of Australia, followed by several other books about wine including Hunter Wine, Scents and Sensuality and Food on the Plate, Wine in the Glass. Many of these books relate to his third career as a "flavourolgist", his description of his "attempt to understand how taste, smell and flavour shaped humanity". Flavour and pleasure were two guiding principles in his life.
