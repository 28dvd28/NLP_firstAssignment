Saint Vincent de Paul Chapel is a Catholic church in Paris, France's 6th arrondissement, 95 rue de Sèvres. It is dedicated to the French saint Vincent de Paul (1581–1660) where his remains are venerated in a silver reliquary (made by Charles Odiot) above the main altar.

History
This chapel is a church of the Vincentians, founded by Vincent de Paul in 1625 and relocated here in 1817  rue de Sèvres, after being expelled from their mother house of Saint-Lazare by the French Revolution.To honour their founder, the Vincentians built this chapel in order to shelter his relics. The first stone was laid on 17 August 1826. The chapel was consecrated on 1 November 1827 by Archbishop de Quélen. It was restored in 1983 and 1992. It was registered in the Monument historiques on 27 March 1994.
The tomb of another Vincentian saint, Jean-Gabriel Perboyre, can be found as well in the chapel.
