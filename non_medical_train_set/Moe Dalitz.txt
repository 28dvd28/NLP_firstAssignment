Morris Barney Dalitz (December 25, 1899 â€“ August 31, 1989) was an American gangster, businessman, casino owner, and philanthropist. He was one of the major figures who shaped Las Vegas in the 20th century. He was often referred to as "Mr. Las Vegas".

Early life
Dalitz was born on December 25, 1899, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Jewish parents, Barnet "Bernard" Dalitz (b. May 8, 1874 in Austria) and Anna Cohen (b. October 1876 in Austria). He was raised in Michigan.
He worked in his family's laundry business early on, but began his career in bootlegging when Prohibition began in 1919, and capitalized on his access to the laundry trucks in the family business. Additionally, he developed a partnership with the Maceo syndicate which ran Galveston and supplied liquor from Canada and Mexico. Though he admitted under oath that he had been a bootlegger and had operated illegal gambling houses, Dalitz was never convicted of a crime. During Senator Estes Kefauver's committee hearings investigating organized crime, when questioned about his bootlegging, Dalitz said: "If you people wouldn't have drunk it, I wouldn't have bootlegged it."With the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Dalitz turned to gambling and operated illegal but protected casinos in Steubenville, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky. For part of its ten-year run, Dalitz ran The Pettibone Club, an illegal gambling hall that operated in far southwest Geauga County, Ohio (on Pettibone Road east of Solon) from 1939 to 1949. He enlisted in the Army in World War II on June 25, 1942 and rose in rank from private to first lieutenant. He discharged on May 29, 1945.

Career
His investment in Las Vegas began in the late 1940s with the Desert Inn. When the original builder of the resort, Wilbur Clark, ran out of money, Dalitz and the Cleveland Mayfield Road Gang bailed him out. The casino opened in 1950. Clark remained the public face and frontman of the resort; Dalitz quietly remained in the background as the real owner. He also ran the Stardust Resort & Casino for a time after the death of Tony Cornero. Dalitz owned the Desert Inn until 1967, when he sold it to Howard Hughes. The last casino that Dalitz owned was the Sundance Hotel Casino, later renamed Fitzgerald's, and most recently, The D Las Vegas.
With Allard Roen, Irwin Molasky and Merv Adelson, he founded Paradise Development, a real estate development company in the 1950s. The partners founded the Sunrise Hospital, The Boulevard Mall and the Las Vegas Country Club. Later, they co-founded the La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California.In a 1983 SUN interview, Dalitz said he considered construction of the Las Vegas Convention Center to be his greatest achievement. "Las Vegas used to be just a gambling town. Now we are a resort destination. The Convention Center complements our purpose," he said.

Philanthropy
In 1982, Dalitz received the "Torch of Liberty" award from the Anti-Defamation League. It was presented by comedian Joan Rivers.

His first marriage was to Edna Louise Keating whom he married March 23, 1922 in Indiana, and after that to Toni Clark, whom he married December 8, 1945 in Dade County, Florida. In 1946, they had a son, Andrew B. Dalitz; he died in 1972.
