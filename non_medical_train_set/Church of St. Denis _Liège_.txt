The Church of St Denis originally had the status of collegiate church. It was one of the seven collegiate churches of Liège, which until the Liège Revolution of 1789 collectively comprised the "secondary clergy" in the First Estate of the Prince-bishopric of Liège. 
The church was suppressed in 1797, but the building was taken into use as a parish church in 1803.The church has since 1936 been included on a heritage register, and is currently listed as "exceptional heritage" of Wallonia.
