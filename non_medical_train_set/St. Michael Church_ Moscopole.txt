It is a basilica-type church with a main nave and two lateral aisles. The dimensions are 33m x 15m x 9m. There are two main pillars. Two lines of columns divide the  central nave from the two lateral aisles and all three aisles have the same height as the naos. The columns are connected among one another on both directions. Each one of the three aisles has a cupola, and each one of the three cupolas is different. On the eastern side the apse is outside of the cupola and some pillars cover it. The narthex is on the western side, and its construction is similar to the remaining part of the naos. The narthex has stone columns with arches and cupolas. The cloister is absent as it has been destroyed, but there are still signs of the original one.
