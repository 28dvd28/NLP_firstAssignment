The Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge comprises the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS) and the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). It is housed in the Centre for Mathematical Sciences site in West Cambridge, alongside the Isaac Newton Institute. Many distinguished mathematicians have been members of the faculty.

Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics
The Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS) was created in 1964 under the headship of Sir William Hodge.  It was housed in a converted warehouse at 16 Mill Lane, adjacent to its sister department DAMTP, until its move around 2000 to the present Centre for Mathematical Sciences where it occupies Pavilions C, D, and E.

1969–1984 J. W. S. Cassels
1984–1991 D. J. H. Garling

Statistical Laboratory
The Statistical Laboratory is a Sub-Department of DPMMS. It was created in 1947 with accommodation in a "temporary hut", and was established on 21 March 1953 within the Faculty of Mathematics. It moved in 1958 to the basement of the new Chemistry Department in Lensfield Road, and then formed part of the new Department (DPMMS) in Mill Lane on its creation in 1964. It occupies Pavilion D of the Centre for Mathematical Sciences.

Directors of the Statistical Laboratory
1953–1956 John Wishart
1956–1957 Henry Daniels, Acting Director
1957–1960 Dennis Lindley
1960–1962 Morris Walker, Acting Director
1962–1973 David Kendall
1973–1987 Peter Whittle
1987–1991 David Williams
1991–1993 Frank Kelly
1994–2000 Geoffrey Grimmett
2000–2009 Richard Weber
2009–2017 James Norris
2017– Richard Samworth

Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics
The Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) was founded by George Batchelor in 1959, and for many years was situated on Silver Street, in the former office buildings of Cambridge University Press. Currently, the Department is located at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge). Theoretical Physics (including cosmology, relativity, and high energy physics) occupies most of Pavilion B, while Applied Mathematics (including fluid dynamics and solid mechanics) occupies most of Pavilions F, G, and H.

Heads of department
1959–1983 George Batchelor
1983–1991 Keith Moffatt
1991–2000 David Crighton
2000–2005 Timothy J. Pedley
