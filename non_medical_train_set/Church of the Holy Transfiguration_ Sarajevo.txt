The Church of the Holy Transfiguration (Serbian: Црква Светог Преображења, romanized: Crkva Svetog Preobraženja) is a Serbian Orthodox church in Novo Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Originally planned for Split in Croatia, it was built in 1940 by Aleksandar Deroko and consecrated by Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V. It was the place of worship for 50,000 adherents in the region. It is the only Orthodox church in Novo Sarajevo.
During the Yugoslav Wars, the Church was heavily damaged, and after the war it was renovated. Reworking of frescoes began in 2004.
