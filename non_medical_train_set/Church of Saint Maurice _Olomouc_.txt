Church of Saint Maurice (Czech: Kostel svatého Mořice) is a Roman Catholic church in Olomouc, Czech Republic. It is located in the city centre, near the Horní náměstí ("Upper Square") and remains one of the most important landmarks of the city.
It is unknown when exactly the church was constructed. It has two towers – the southern tower dates back to 1403, which is the oldest part of the building; the northern one dates back to 1412. The church was probably consecrated in 1492. The Neo-Gothic main altar was built in 1861. The church is built as arched triple-nave. Main nave contains the church organ, originating from 1740 to 1745; with its five manuals and 95 registers, it is among the largest organs in the world. Their author was organist Michael Engler.
The church was designated a National Cultural Landmark by the government in 1995. The southern tower serves as a lookout tower with view on the whole city of Olomouc and surroundings.
