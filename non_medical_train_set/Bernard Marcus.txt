In 1978, both he and future  Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank were fired during a corporate power struggle at Handy Dan.
In 1978, they co-founded the home-improvement retailer The Home Depot, with the help of merchandising expert Pat Farrah and New York investment banker Ken Langone who assembled a group of investors.
