Of his charitable works, Krieger said, "I did it because it gives me a great deal of satisfaction to be able to benefit others. I think the basis of life is satisfaction. We all do things to satisfy ourselves. If you have money, you might as well be able to enjoy it. I enjoy giving."Perhaps his best known charitable contribution was a $50 million challenge grant to the Johns Hopkins University School of Arts and Sciences in 1992.

I felt I had given birth to something only to have this rascal come in and take it away. And the way he did it...it is something you never get over. Never."
In 1966, Krieger was named as lead of a Baltimore group awarded an alternate National Hockey League franchise that would come about if ownership for the conditional St. Louis franchise could not be found.He sold his Orioles shares to Edward Bennett Williams in 1979.
