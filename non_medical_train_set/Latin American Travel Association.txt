The Latin American Travel Association (LATA) is a UK travel industry association whose purpose is to promote travel to Latin American destinations.
Its members include airlines, tour operator's and travel agents, as well as tourist boards of various Latin American countries. There are over 200 members in all, ranging from large airlines such as Air France and Iberia to individual hotels.
LATA claims to vet members before they join, but does not actually offer any form of consumer protection (unlike ABTA or ATOL bonding).
Its website includes a member directory and a brief tourist guide to the countries of Latin America.
