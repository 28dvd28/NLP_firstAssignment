United States Navy
Miller served in the United States Navy from 1942 -1946. He attended university on the G.I. Bill, earning a master's degree in English (1953) from the University of California at Berkeley where he also completed post-degree work in drama and helped found the university's Graduate Student Journal.
Throughout his career, Miller has promoted and published other writers. In Dices, or Black Bones, (1970), he showcased the early poems of Al Young, California's poet laureate (2005–2008),  Ishmael Reed, Clarence Major, Lucille Clifton, Etheridge Knight and Victor Hernandez Cruz.  Miller's own first book of poetry was Neighborhood and Other Poems (1992), followed by Forever Afternoon (1994) published by Michigan State University Press; next came Apocalypse Is My Garden (1997) and Land Between (2000). Ticket to Exile, A Memoir (2007) was published by Heyday Books.

He  has worked with San Francisco Bay Area public television and radio for over 30 years, creating programs on Norwegian culture and arts, the writings of Nisei (Japanese-Americans), women's history and labor history.
