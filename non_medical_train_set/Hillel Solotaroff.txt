Hillel Solotaroff (1865â€“1921) was a doctor known for his leadership in the New York Jewish/Yiddish anarchist movement. Solotaroff emigrated from Elizabetgrad in 1882 and while he pursued medical school, wrote for anarchist publications and was an exceptionally popular speaker. He became a member of the Jewish anarchist group Pioneers of Liberty and introduced the anarchist duo Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Solotaroff continued writing through his life for various publications, writing a daily column for yiddish-language daily newspaper Der Tog (The Day). Later in his life, Solotaroff's views moved towards nationalism and Socialist Zionism.
