The brigade was assigned shortly thereafter to the 16th Division. He left this position in April 1937. Between March and June 1938, he served as commander of the 33rd Division, on the inactive Guadalajara front. On August 15 of that year he received command of the 37th Division of the VII Army Corps, which had been profoundly reorganized after the battle of Merida pocket—during which the unit was severely broken. He left command of the division in February 1939.He was captured by the nationalists at the end of the war and was taken prisoner, passing through the concentration camps of Los Almendros and Albatera, thus as for various prisons. In 1942, he was court-martialled and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
