In 1975, a trust fund was established at Churchill College in his memory, endowed initially through the publication in his honour of two volumes of papers, edited by E. F. Harding and D. G. Kendall.The Rollo Davidson Trust has awarded an annual prize to young probabilists since 1976, and has organized occasional lectures in honour of Davidson. Since 2012 the Trust
has also awarded an annual Thomas Bond Sprague Prize.
