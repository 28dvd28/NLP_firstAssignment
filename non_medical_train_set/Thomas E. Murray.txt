Thomas E. Murray (October 21, 1860 – July 21, 1929) was an American inventor and businessman who developed electric power plants for New York City as well as many electrical devices which influenced life around the world, including the dimmer switch and screw-in fuse.  It has been said that he "invented everything from the power plant up to the light bulb".
Murray is considered one of the most prolific inventors in history after Thomas Edison, holding 462 U.S. patents in his name.  However, unlike Edison, Murray did not patent the work of others under his name; the employee would have the patent in their name, and assign it to the Murray company. Also, if Murray worked with anyone else on an invention, their name would be listed on the patent.

Early life
Thomas E. Murray was born in Albany, New York, to an Irish family and was one of 12 children. He left school upon the death of his father when he was nine to help support his family by working three jobs.

Murray was responsible for the power stations that powered New York City for the first half of the 20th century.  He eventually was in complete charge of all the allied Edison companies in New York City, Brooklyn, and Westchester.
