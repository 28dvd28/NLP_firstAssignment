Planetary system
The planetary system of Kepler-27 comprising two small gas giants on eccentric orbits was discovered in late 2011. The planets Kepler-27b and Kepler-27c have equilibrium temperatures of 610 K and 481 K, respectively. In 2021, a third, sub-Neptune-sized planet was confirmed, orbiting closer in than the other two planets.
