Lasse Rempe (born 20 January 1978) is a German mathematician born in Kiel. His research interests include holomorphic dynamics, function theory, continuum theory and computational complexity theory. He currently holds the position of Professor for Pure Mathematics, and Deputy Head of Department for REF at the University of Liverpool. Rempe recorded the voiceover for a BBC feature on the art of mathematics, where he explained how certain pictures have arisen from dynamical systems.

Name
