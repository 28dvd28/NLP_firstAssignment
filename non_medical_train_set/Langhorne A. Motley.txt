Early life
Motley was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Time Magazine described Langhorne A. Motley as "The son of an American oil executive and a British-Brazilian mother, he was born and grew up amid sun-splashed privilege in Rio de Janeiro. After graduating from The Citadel in Charleston, S.C., Motley joined the Air Force and was posted from 1965 to 1967 in Panama—his only Central American experience—and later in Alaska. There he switched careers and founded what has since become the largest real estate firm in the state."

Quotes
According to a Foreign Policy Article "The Art of Leaking" published January 20, 2010, "An assistant secretary of state, Langhorne A. Motley, once defined a leak as a "premature unauthorized partial disclosure."  
According to a news item on the St. John's University Website "Ambassador Motley then discussed his experiences working with Latin America and some general principals of U.S. relations with Latin America in general, as well as specific countries.  He also emphasized the importance and relevance of our country's foreign policy towards Latin American nations. "Up through World War II, you could separate foreign policy from domestic policy," said Ambassador Motley. "This is no longer true. Today many issues at the center of Latin American policy are also domestic issues."
