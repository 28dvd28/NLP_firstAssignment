Pavel Ilyich Etingof (Russian: Павел Ильич Этингоф; born 1969) is an American mathematician of Russian-Ukrainian origin. He does research on the intersection of mathematical physics (exactly integrable systems) and representation theory, e.g., quantum groups.

Biography
Etingof was born in Kyiv, Ukrainian SSR, and studied in the Kyiv Natural Science Lyceum No. 145 in 1981–1984, and at the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv in 1984–1986. He received his M.S. in applied mathematics from the Oil and Gas Institute in Moscow in 1989 and then went to the US in 1990. In 1994, he received his PhD in mathematics at Yale University under Igor Frenkel with thesis Representation Theory and Holonomic Systems. After his PhD, he became Benjamin Peirce Assistant Professor at Harvard University and in 1998 an assistant professor at MIT. Since 2005 he is a professor at MIT. 
In 1999, he was a Fellow of the Clay Mathematics Institute.
In 2002, he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing (On the dynamical Yang–Baxter equation). He is a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
In 2010, together with Slava Gerovitch he co-founded the MIT Program for Research In Mathematics, Engineering and Science (PRIMES) for high school students, and has since served as its Chief Research Advisor.In 2016, he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
