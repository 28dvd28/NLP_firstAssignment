Learson and Katharine E. (Goode) Learson.  He graduated from Boston Latin School in 1931, then majored in mathematics at Harvard University, graduating in 1935.
From 1975 to 1977 he was Ambassador-at-Large for Law of the Sea Matters and Special Representative of the President for the Law of the Sea Conference, and Chief of Delegation.
He died at age 84 and is buried with his wife Gladys at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery, in Hawthorne, New York.
