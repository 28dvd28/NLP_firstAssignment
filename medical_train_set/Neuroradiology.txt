The specialty neuroradiology societies that are associated with the ASNR include the American Society of Pediatric Neuroradiology (ASPNR), the American Society of Spine Radiology (ASSR), the American Society of Head and Neck Radiology (ASHNR), and the American Society of Functional Neuroradiology (ASFNR). These societies contribute to the programming of the ASNR annual meeting and also hold their own annual meetings.

In Japan, it is the Japanese Neuroradiological Society; in the UK, it is the British Society of Neuroradiologists (BSNR); and in France, it is the French Society of Neuroradiology (SFNR).
