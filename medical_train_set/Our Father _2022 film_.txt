"Shocking, creepy, and—at times—just plain strange, Our Father is a documentary that proves sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. —Collider
"At its core, 'Our Father' is a lesson for any future true-crime documentaries—that such stories are strongest when their victims are front and center. While the execution muddies the film's message, the power of its subjects shines through the clouds." —Duke Chronicle
"Director Lucie Jourdan’s 'Our Father,' a frustrating, tawdry documentary, rips a headline for trashy dramatic beats. —RogerEbert.com
