In the 2003 season, there were two air race venues only, Zeltweg in Austria and Budapest in Hungary.
Six pilots competed in the first leg. Due to a timing dispute, no points were given. In the second and final round, only three pilots participated. Hungarian PÃ©ter Besenyei won the race in Budapest and so the 2003 championship with 6 points. Klaus Schrodt from Germany became second before the American pilot Kirby Chambliss.
