World Finals
Red Bull BC One took place in Paris, France. For the 2014 World Finals, Red Bull BC One utilized a round-by-round judging system used by Undisputed. The round-by-round judging format allows boys to see the judges decision after every round. The battle is set for 3 rounds (Finals is 5) but can end if a bboy beats his opponent in 2. The format should make boys give 100% each and every round because the more unanimous rounds they win, the more rounds they will have heading into the semi-finals and final battle. However, this judging system received a lot of criticism from Red Bull BC One fans throughout social media following the event. Bboys and fans alike, both disagreed heavily with the judges' decisions after many individual battles. Many argued that it was the worst Red Bull BC one competition since its initiation.
