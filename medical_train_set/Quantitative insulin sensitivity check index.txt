The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) is derived using the inverse of the sum of the logarithms of the fasting insulin and fasting glucose:

1 / (log(fasting insulin μU/mL) + log(fasting glucose mg/dL))This index correlates well with glucose clamp studies (r = 0.78), and is useful for measuring insulin sensitivity (IS), which is the inverse of insulin resistance (IR). It has the advantage of that it can be obtained from a fasting blood sample, and is the preferred method for certain types of clinical research.
There are no documented reference value for QUICKI. In one study, 95% of healthy persons had a QUICKI index above 0.357. Another study concluded that QUICKI index 0.3469 or below should be used to determine insulin resistance.
