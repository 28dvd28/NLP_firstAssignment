Some Sort of Creature
In a live Facebook Q&A session, Aaron described “Some Sort of Creature” as something he truly experienced. “What you hear on that track, a sort of segue track, is really what actually happened! And that's really all I can describe; it's me speaking to myself, because I didn’t want to forget this thing I saw. And it's all right there in the song."
