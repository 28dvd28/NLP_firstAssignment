Tip-edge appliance
Kesling developed the tip-edge appliance in 1986. The brackets of this appliance are made by removing the diagonally opposed corners from Edward Angle's edgewise slot. This allows either mesial or distal tipping of a tooth. One can use small forces such as 2oz to 4oz to move teeth. The appliance is also sometimes referred to as "Kesling the slot".
