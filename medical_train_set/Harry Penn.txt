Lemarco Manufacturing Company
In Roanoke, he established the Lemarco Manufacturing Company to employ blacks, especially black women, in the area. "A Negro dressmaking firm has received over $4,000 in pledges to buy stock in the company. Some 85 Negroes yesterday attended a meeting at the St. Paul Methodist Church and filled out applications for jobs at the LeMarco Manufacturing Co. The dress-making firm was formed by Roanoke Negroes so that more of them could find work. It's backed by the Roanoke Development Association. Dr. Harry Penn, who heads up the development company, says about 100 people will be interviewed. The dress factory plans to open for business about March first... It's hoped that about 60 persons eventually will be employed by the firm." The company later folded. "Employees of the Lemarco dress manufacturing company receive new paychecks after the original checks bounced the previous week due to financial troubles within the company." December 24, 1958. and the manufacturing plant was made into a successful nightclub in Roanoke in 1961.In an article about Dr. Penn, published in 2006, the company was described as a personal project: "Penn organized a group of workers at the end of the 1950s and opened Lamarco Manufacturing Co., a dress-making plant on the old Fifth Street in Northwest Roanoke that offered jobs to blacks. To get the business running, Penn mortgaged his home at 923 Madison Ave. N.W. and his Centre Avenue property, Bruner said. The business, which had 55 employees -- about two-thirds of them black -- went under in 1960 with losses totaling $50,000, according to newspaper articles. Penn blamed a personal illness, the high cost of training and an $11,000 loss caused by the failure of a New York company the factory had done business with. "He just got a raw deal from the person he bought the machines from," Bruner said. "He was trying to do something good to help the employment of black women."

Legacy
Penn Hall at the Patrick Henry High School (Roanoke, Virginia) is named in his honor. "Penn Hall will be the last of these buildings to go. In 1975, it was named in honor of Dr. Harry T. Penn, a dentist, businessman and civic activist. In 1942, Penn became the first black candidate for city council. He had the support of the 300-member Roanoke Civic League, "the most representative body of colored citizens in the city," according to a Roanoke Times clipping. But his bid failed, as did his campaigns in 1944 and 1952. In 1948, Councilman Benton O. Dillard nominated Penn for the school board. Two other councilmen declined to participate in the vote, offering no explanations. But Penn did become the first black person appointed to the board, "at least to the knowledge of local school officials," the paper reported. He served one three-year term. Penn, a Lynchburg native and longtime critic of segregation, was a member of an interracial committee to improve race relations in 1960. He died in 1963 at age 61."
