Reckless Disregard is a 1985 American film that was directed by Harvey Hart. It stars Tess Harper as a lawyer that must defend a physician against claims of selling prescriptions. After accepting the part Harper commented that the role was different from those she'd played in the past such as "rural mothers". The film has drawn comparisons to the 1983 Galloway lawsuit against Dan Rather as well as the case of Westmoreland vs. CBS.

Reception
The Los Angeles Times reviewed the film and drew parallels to the 1983 Galloway lawsuit against Dan Rather. The New York Times made similar comments, stating that "The way reality has been rendered into fiction with ''Reckless Disregard'' illustrates how film makers try to heighten drama by sharpening and simplifying murky issues." People panned the film, writing that "In the wake of Westmoreland vs. CBS, there's a compelling movie to be made about how TV news works, how the producers do all the work and the anchors get all the credit, how interviews are edited, how news and entertainment merge on TV. But this isn't that movie."
