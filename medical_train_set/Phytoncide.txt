Phytoncides are antimicrobial  allelochemic volatile organic compounds derived from plants. The word, which means "exterminated by the plant" (from the Greek φυτόν "plant" and the Latin caedere "to kill"), was coined in 1928 by Dr. Boris P. Tokin, a Soviet biochemist then studying at Moscow State University.
He found that some plants give off very active substances that help to prevent them from rotting or from being eaten by some insects and animals.

Occurrence and function
Cedar, garlic, locust, oak, onion, pine, tea tree, many spices, and many other plants give off phytoncides. Garlic contains allicin and diallyl disulfide. Pine contains alpha-pinene, carene, myrcene, and other terpenes. Sophora flavescens contains sophoraflavanone G. 
More than 5,000 volatile substances defend plants that protect them from bacteria, fungi, and insects. Phytoncides work by inhibiting or preventing the growth of the attacking organism.

Use
They are widely used in Russian, Ukrainian, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese medicine, as well as in alternative medicine, aromatherapy, and veterinary medicine.
