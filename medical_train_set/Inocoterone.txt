Inocoterone (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name; developmental code name RU-29294) is a steroid-like nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) that was never marketed. An acetate ester, inocoterone acetate, shows greater antiandrogen activity and was developed, as a topical medication for the treatment of acne but showed only modest effectiveness in clinical trials and similarly was never marketed.
