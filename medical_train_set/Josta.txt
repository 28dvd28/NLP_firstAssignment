Josta was a soft drink brand that was produced by PepsiCo and the first energy drink ever introduced by a major US beverage company. It was marketed as a "high-energy drink" with guarana and caffeine.
Josta was introduced in 1995, but PepsiCo pulled the drink from its lineup due to a change in corporate strategy in 1999. Shortly before the beverage was discontinued, an "Association for Josta Saving" was started. A "Save Josta" campaign was also launched by fans of the drink; their website "www.savejosta.org" was defunct for several years but was reactivated in 2011.
