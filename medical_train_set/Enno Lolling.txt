On September 13, 1936, Lolling obtained the rank of Hauptsturmführer. From May 2, 1936 till May 29, he completed an exercise with the Kriegsmarine {navy). On July 30, 1936, he had to assert that he had been free from morphine since 1932 and therefore was not addicted.
Lolling was accepted as a general practitioner and in September 1936, was appointed SS squadron doctor and medic with the SS-Verfügungstruppe at the SS military academy in Bad Tölz. In early November 1936, he became a doctor at the SS military hospital in Dachau.In early 1939, Lolling was deployed with the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf.

On March 3, 1942, he was put in charge of Amt D III of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt for Medical Services and Camp Hygiene, with headquarters at Oranienburg, at the edge of Sachsenhausen concentration camp. With this promotion, he was put in charge of all medical units and doctors at all SS concentration camps. From May to July 1942, he was forced to take a leave of absence because of a serious illness.

After this final promotion, Lolling ordered a collection of human skins with tattoos to be prepared in different ways and sent to Berlin. Hundreds were prepared. Healthy prisoners were killed with an injection to the heart, so as not to damage the tattoos. Lolling also ordered SS doctors to experiment with shrinking human heads and at least three were shrunk.Lolling was responsible for assigning doctors to the various SS-run concentration camps. He was superior to the Standortarzt at each camp, who in turn, were superior to the camp doctors assigned to them. During the Hamburg Ravensbrück Trials, he was repeatedly named by the accused as the medical person in authority.
On May 27, 1945, Lolling committed suicide at the reserve army hospital in Flensburg. He was 56.
