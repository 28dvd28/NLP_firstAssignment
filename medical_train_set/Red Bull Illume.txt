Red Bull Illume is an international photography contest for adventure and action sports photography organized by Red Bull. It focuses on photographers from around the world and showcases photos of various sports, including surfing and biking. Red Bull Illume has several partners who help to foster the Red Bull Illume Image Quest yearly. In some years an exhibition tour showcasing the 50 finalist images has toured North America or cities around the world.

In video games
In PlayStation Home, Red Bull released a virtual themed space for the Red Bull Illume on November 26, 2009. It is an exhibition of adventure and action sports photographs from Red Bull Illume. The winning photograph from each of the competitionâ€™s ten categories is displayed on large illuminate cubes, imitating the real-life exhibit. There is also an exit to the Red Bull Air Race space and the Red Bull Beach space which features the Red Bull Flugtag.
