Friedrich Panse (31 December 1899 in Essen – 6 December 1973 in Bochum) was a German psychiatrist who was involved with the Nazi T-4 Euthanasia Program. He was an advisor who "expertly guided" patients into gas chambers.
After the war, in 1948, Dr. Panse was tried, but he was acquitted. His defense that was that if he had not participated, even more patients would have died. He was then made Director of the psychiatric clinic of the Medical Academy of the Rhine Hospital in Düsseldorf. In 1965 he was elected president of the German Society for Psychiatry and Neurology.
