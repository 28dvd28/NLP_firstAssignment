Charles Michael "Bucky" Lasek ( LAY-sik; born December 3, 1972) is an American professional skateboarder and rallycross driver.

Career
Professional skateboarding
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Lasek started skateboarding at the age of 12, shortly after his bike was stolen. After entering amateur contests, he was quickly noticed by Powell Peralta talent scouts in 1987.  Powell Peralta promptly sponsored Lasek and introduced him in a 1987 publication as a 14 year old newly-sponsored amateur who "rides a mini-Caballero with X-Bones."  Lasek made his video debut in the fourth Bones Brigade video, Public Domain (1988).Lasek attained professional status with Powell in 1990, but by this time, skateboarding, and vert skateboarding (Lasek's discipline) in particular, began to lose popularity and his career waned. After vert skateboarding was included as part of the X Games by ESPN in the mid-1990s, Lasek's career was revived. A move from Baltimore to San Diego in the summer of 1998 helped his career further.As of May 2009, Lasek owns a backyard concrete skateboarding bowl named "Lasekland".

Professional racing
In May 2012, Lasek was one of three drivers selected by Subaru Rally Team USA to compete in the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship. Lasek continued with the team earning several second and third place finishes through his career with Subaru. He left the team after the 2016 season.

Video game appearances
Lasek was a playable character in the first five games in the Tony Hawk's series: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater through Tony Hawk's Underground. He also appears in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2.

Film and television
Lasek made a cameo appearance in the low-budget 2003 movie Haggard, in which he hands a skateboard to Bam Margera while he runs from the villain Hellboy. He appeared in MTV's reality television series Viva La Bam and in the music video for Pink's single "Raise Your Glass". He served as a stunt double in the 2003 movie Grind. He also made an appearance as himself in an episode of The Jersey called "What's Gotten Into Elliott Rifkin?", and also attended the sixth dinner service of Hell's Kitchen's 21st season.
