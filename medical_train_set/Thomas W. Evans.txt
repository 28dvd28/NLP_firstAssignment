The statue was prominently displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1889.He was famous for having assisted the Empress Eugénie in escaping from Paris in 1870, along with Joseph Bonaparte's grandson Louis Joseph Benton, after the Battle of Sedan.He died in Paris, where he had lived for many years, and was buried in Woodlands Cemetery, Philadelphia.  In his will, he left money and land for the founding of what was to become the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine.
