Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) is an online database of genes, inherited disorders and traits in more than 135 animal species. It is modelled on, and is complementary to, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). It aims to provide a publicly accessible catalogue of all animal phenes, excluding those in human and mouse, for which species specific resources are already available (OMIM, MLC). Authored by Professor Frank Nicholas of the University of Sydney, with some contribution from colleagues, the database contains textual information and references as well as links to relevant PubMed and Gene records at the NCBI.
OMIA is hosted by the University of Sydney, with an Entrez mirror located at the NCBI.

Maintenance
Currently the database is curated by its founder Professor Frank Nicholas. Planning is well advanced for enabling international experts to serve as electronic curators within their areas of expertise. Technical maintenance and improvement of OMIA has historically been conducted by a range of individuals.
