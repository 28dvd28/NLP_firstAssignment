Lorenzo Yates was born on January 12, 1837, on the Isle of Sheppey. He attended various private schools and by the age of 14 moved to New York City. His studies were varied ranging from dentistry and medicine to chemistry and mineralogy and even fossil collections.

He sent the jaw to Yale College for examination and collected more elephant fossils which he found 40 feet (12 m) below the surface in 1872 which were examined at the Wabash College. He also discovered some amphibious animals that he called The Marine Monsters of Alameda County since he found them there. Between June 12, 1875, to August 11, 1877, he wrote articles titles "Rambles of a Naturalist." The articles covered the "Indians of Clear Lake," the "Mound-Builders" of the Washington Township and Murray Township, now Southern Alameda County and South East Alameda County, and fossils found in the region.
