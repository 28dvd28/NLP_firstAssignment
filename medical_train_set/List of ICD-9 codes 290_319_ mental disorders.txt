This is a shortened version of the fifth chapter of the ICD-9: Mental Disorders. It covers ICD codes 290 to 319. The full chapter can be found on pages 177 to 213 of Volume 1, which contains all (sub)categories of the ICD-9. Volume 2 is an alphabetical index of Volume 1. Both volumes can be downloaded for free from the website of the World Health Organization. See here for a PDF file of only the mental disorders chapter.
Chapter 5 of the ICD-9, which was first published in 1977, was used in the field of psychiatry for approximately three and a half decades. In the United States, an extended version of the ICD-9 was developed called the ICD-9-CM. Several editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or the DSM, interfaced with the codes of the ICD-9-CM. Following the DSM-II (1968), which used the ICD-8, the ICD-9-CM was used by the DSM-III (1980), the DSM-III-R (1987), the DSM-IV (1994), and the DSM-IV-TR (2000). The DSM-5 (2013), the current version, also features ICD-9-CM codes, listing them alongside the codes of Chapter V of the ICD-10-CM. On 1 October 2015, the United States health care system officially switched from the ICD-9-CM to the ICD-10-CM.The DSM is the authoritative reference work in diagnosing mental disorders in the world. The ICD system is used to code these disorders, and strictly seen, the ICD has always been the official system of diagnosing mental diseases in the United States. Due to the dominance of the DSM, however, not even many professionals within psychiatry realize this. The DSM and the ICD form a 'dual-system': the DSM is used for categories and diagnostic criteria, while the ICD-codes are used to make reimbursement claims towards the health insurance companies. The ICD also contains diagnostic criteria, but for the most part, therapists use those in the DSM. This structure has been criticized, with people wondering why there should be two separate systems for classification of mental disorders. It has been proposed that the ICD supersede the DSM.
