DR SMILE is a brand by the German startup Urban Technology GmbH based in Berlin.

History
DR SMILE was founded in 2016 in Berlin by Jens Urbaniak and Christopher von Wedemeyer. Urbaniak worked for Rocket Internet and is a co-founder of Go Butler, and von Wedemeyer is an alumnus of the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management and previously worked as an analyst.  In July 2020, it was announced that Swiss dental implant manufacturer Straumann bought a majority stake in the start-up and secured an option on the remaining shares.  In May 2022, DR SMILE acquired PlusDental for €131 million.

Company
DR SMILE holds locations in numerous cities, such as Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Cologne, Munich, Nuremberg, Stuttgart or Hannover. The company works with a partner network of dentists and orthodontists.

Treatment
DR SMILE focuses on providing aesthetic dental treatments with invisible aligners to correct minor and medium malpositions of teeth. Before undergoing the therapy, patients are typically examined by a dentist to assess whether their teeth, gums, and jaw are suitable for the procedure.  X-Ray imaging may be conducted if deemed necessary. DR SMILE claims to employ a 3D simulation of the dentition to illustrate the potential changes resulting from the treatment. Subsequently, patients receive their aligners at their homes and are instructed to replace them every two weeks. Throughout the treatment, patients have control appointments scheduled midway and at the end of the process. Additionally, patients are encouraged to send a weekly selfie to their dentist and monitor their progress through an app. The aligners themselves are produced using 3D printer technology.

Controversy
DR SMILE, along with similar companies, has faced criticism from some dental professionals due to concerns about the lack of medical consultation and examination. In particular, criticism has been directed at concepts where patients take impressions of their teeth at home without direct supervision from a dentist. While DR SMILE asserts that it collaborates with dentists and orthodontists, and distances itself from procedures that do not involve professional medical consultation, there have been legal challenges regarding the thoroughness of the examination process. For example, in 2019, a German court ruled that certain dental standards were not met. Furthermore, the company is currently under investigation by Polish authorities after numerous customers in Poland reported experiencing serious dental issues following the use of aligners provided by DR SMILE. Allegations against the company include accusations of illegal business practices, inadequate medical supervision, and customer deception.
