History
Founded in 2009 by John Dempsey and Lee Field, Bomb Energy Drink separates itself from the competition with its unique Bag-In-Box format. This unique availability, coupled with its tart citrusy taste and value pricing had allowed it to rapidly expand its share of the Canadian market. Popularity of the beverage was furthered increased by their appearance on the Canadian edition of Dragons' Den in January 2013. The pitch was unsuccessful.
On January 28, 2015, Bomb Energy Drink was featured in an update segment on Dragonsâ€™ Den.  One year after their initial appearance on the show, sales of Bomb Energy more than tripled, making Bomb the fastest growing energy drink in Canada.
Unfortunately the hype went away as fast as it came and the company went bankrupt in 2022.
