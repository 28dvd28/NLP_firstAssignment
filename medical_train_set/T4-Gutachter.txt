The T4-Gutachter (in English, 'Action T4 experts') were medical experts who were employed by the Zentraldienststelle-T4 to organize and carry out the Action T4 euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. Based on reporting forms with information about the mentally ill and disabled, they decided who would be killed in "euthanasia" centers.
