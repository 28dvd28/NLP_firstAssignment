Reception
When My Heart Felt Volcanic received positive reviews from critics noted at review aggregator Metacritic. It has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on four reviews. Johnny Rogerson of Clash Magazine gave the album a 7 out of 10, stating that they have "escape[d] the indie clichés attached to pop bands using guitars, and have created a fully-fledged pop scorcher". In The Line of Best Fit, Pip Williams rated this release a 6 out of 10, calling it a "breezy, fun debut", but criticizing the band for not being more experimental with their sound. Writing for NME, Hannah Mylrea calls this album "sugar with substance" and rates it 4 out of 5 stars, writing that "Fake Nice" "could be one of the best pop songs of the year". NPR's Lyndsey McKenna writes in First Listen that the band has a similar sound to contemporary acts such as The 1975, Haim, and Paramore, but "here's a timelessness to the construction" of this album that makes it "a refined mission statement from a band with history" that is the kind of pop music "that's fit to be blasted from car stereos and sung along to at high volumes".
