Liquid X is a brand of energy drink originally developed in Amsterdam for the rave scene. Liquid X has a citrus taste that can be related to the taste of Mountain Dew AMP. Liquid X claims to be the only "euphoric" energy drink available, meaning that it has no caffeine. It utilizes hormones and herbal mixtures to create energy.
In 2021, Liquid X was no longer available in pure form and it is now sold online as a water additive. The new formula has caffeine added.
