At Polygon Wood on 25/9/17 this officer was in charge of "A" Coy the right company in the line. He was on the extreme right of the 15 Bde Sector. At 5:30 AM his line was heavily attacked by the enemy. By the vigorous resistance of his Coy the enemy was beaten back and the front line held intact. The enemy penetrated the front & support lines of the 1st Middlesex and enfiladed him by Machine Gun fire. This officer formed a defensive flank & foiled repeated attempts by the enemy to roll up his line. His personal work was magnificent & his courage inspired his men to hold out in a desperate situation. Had he failed to hold his line the success of the attack on the following morning would have been in jeopardy. It was largely owing to his celerity in appreciating the situation that the Brigade front was held intact. (29 September 1917)
