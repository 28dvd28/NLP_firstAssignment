In 2020, the company introduced a line of fruit snacks in mixed fruit, Arnold Palmer, and green tea varieties.

History
The company roots trace back to 1971 when friends John Ferolito and Don Vultaggio opened a beverage distribution business in Brooklyn, New York. The company was a successful beer distributor.
In 1990, they saw the success of Snapple (also a Long-Island-based company founded in the 1970s) bottled juices and teas, and attempted to make their product. In 1992, they produced the first bottles of their own AriZona teas. Vultaggio said the name was originally Santa Fe, in response to the adobe-style house he lived in, but he felt it did not look right on the packaging. He went with Arizona even though he had never been to the state and, in fact, had not even traveled west of the Mississippi River.The suggested price printed on the can has remained at $0.99 even with rising costs for the company. Retailers, however, can set their own price.
