Red Bull BC One is an annual international B-Boy competition organized by the beverage company Red Bull. It is an individual B-Boy competition, notable for being the only one of the major international breaking championships to not include a crew event. The main event is a knockout tournament featuring sixteen B-Boys and B-Girls, chosen for exceptional skills in the dance and good character, competing in one-on-one battles decided by a panel of five judges. Regional finals are held for North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and Middle East and Africa. The winners of each region go on and participate in the World Finals. The inaugural BC One was held in Biel, Switzerland in 2004.
An official Red Bull BC One DVD was released for the 2004 and 2005 events. The production of the DVDs has been criticized due to restrictive music playing rights, as the live music played during the competition had to be dubbed over. From 2006 onwards, Red Bull stopped releasing DVDs and made the videos available online for free.In 2007, Alastair Siddon directed a film about the Red Bull BC One 2007 competition. The film was released in March 2010 under the title, Turn it Loose.
Since 2014, Red Bull BC One partnered up with the World BBoy Series and helped create Undisputed, an event to crown the solo world b-boy champion.

2014
Red Bull BC One took place in Paris, France. In 2014, Red Bull BC One utilized a round-by-round judging system used by Undisputed. The round-by-round judging format allows boys to see the judges decision after every round. The battle is set for 3 rounds (Finals is 5) but can end if a boy beats his opponent in 2. However, this judging system received a lot of criticism from Red Bull BC One fans throughout social media following the event. Bboys and fans alike, both disagreed heavily with the judges's decisions after many individual battles. Many argued that it was the worst Red Bull BC one competition since its initiation. Due to Menno () winning Red Bull BC One and Chelles Battle Pro, Gravity () was awarded the final spot at Undisputed at the end of the year following Red Bull BC One.
