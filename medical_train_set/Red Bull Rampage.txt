The Red Bull Rampage is an invitation-only freeride mountain bike competition held near Zion National Park in Virgin, Utah, United States, just to the north of Gooseberry Mesa. From 2001 till 2004, it was held off the Kolob Terrace Road, on the western boundary of Zion National Park.

History
The competition took place from 2001 till 2004. However, by 2005 the organisers canceled due to the increasing risk competitors were taking. After a three-year hiatus, Rampage returned in 2008 at a new venue. The organizers introduced wooden features for the 2008 event. Previously, the competition took place on a natural piste, meaning it was devoid of manmade features.The event usually occurs in October. Its format is similar to freestyle skiing and freestyle snowboarding, where competitors are judged on their choice of lines down the hill, their technical ability and the complexity and amplitude of tricks. Since its inception, Red Bull Rampage has become one of the biggest events in the Freeride mountainbiking (FMB) calendar.At the first ever Rampage in 2001, the prize money for the event was $8,000. In 2015, the total prize fund was $100,000.
