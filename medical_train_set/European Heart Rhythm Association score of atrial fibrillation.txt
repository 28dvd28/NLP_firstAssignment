The European Heart Rhythm Association score of atrial fibrillation (or EHRA score) is a classification system for the extent of atrial fibrillation. It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regard to normal breathing and varying degrees in shortness of breath and/or angina.
The classification system is named after the European Heart Rhythm Association.
