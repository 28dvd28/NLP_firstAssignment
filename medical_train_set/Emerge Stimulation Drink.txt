Emerge is a carbonated mixed-fruit flavour energy drink from the United Kingdom which contains taurine and caffeine. It is produced by the Cott Corporation at their packaging facility at Kegworth in Leicestershire. It is sold in Sainsburys, Asda, Poundland, Home Bargains and other retailers, usually newsagents.
 Its primary difference from competing brand-name energy drinks such as Red Bull and Relentless is the comparatively lower RRP of between 59p and 75p (250ml can). It can often be found at a lower price than this, for example in pound shops or more recently, for loyalty card prices.
The brand is the sixth largest in the UK, after Lucozade, Red Bull, Monster, Relentless and Rockstar.In 2014, 15.1 million litres of the drink was produced, an increase of 24.3% on the previous year.
