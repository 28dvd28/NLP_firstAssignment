Steve Jones (born 5 January 1960) is a British airline and aerobatics pilot who competed in the Red Bull Air Race World Series, flying a Zivko Edge 540. He is now the championship's head judge.
Jones had his first flying lesson at just five years old, in 1965, in a Cessna, on the knee of a family friend. He became a pilot both commercially and competitively.
Commercially, Jones was formerly a captain for British Airways, flying a Boeing 747. He spends his off-season working on and racing vintage cars. His company is also rebuilding two vintage wooden racing aircraft.
Since 1994, Jones has flown competitively and as a display pilot with Paul Bonhomme in their Red Bull Matadors Team. They have taken their show around the world from the UAE to Japan. Jones flies as the wingman. Jones was a competitive Red Bull Air Race pilot from the first UK race which took place in Kemble UK in 2004. In the Red Bull Air Race series of 2007, he won in Porto, Portugal, defeating Mike Mangold.
Jones retired from Airrace as a competitor at the end of the 2008 season. He spent the next two seasons as technical commentator for TV and Internet coverage. 
Red Bull Air Race took a 3-year break, returning in 2014. Jones came back as race director and head of training.  
Jones is not to be confused with Steve Jones, glider pilot, who was winner of the 2001 and 2014 World Gliding Championships.
