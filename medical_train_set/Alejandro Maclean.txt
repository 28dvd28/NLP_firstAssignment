Alejandro "Álex" Maclean (6 August 1969 – 17 August 2010) was a Spanish TV film producer and aerobatics pilot, who competed in the Red Bull Air Race World Championship under the number 36. Maclean was nicknamed "The Flying Matador".
Maclean, whose grandfather was Scottish and hence his family name, was fascinated by airplanes as a child. So, he built and collected model airplanes, and later stepped up to remote controlled planes. At the age of 18, he bought his own Ultralight. Soon, he began to try out some basic manoeuvres in his new plane. The aerobatics resulted in his first accident. Maclean later experienced two more serious air accidents during aerobatics flights.
In 2005 Maclean became captain of the Spanish aerobatics team.
He had a partnership in a TV film production company, enjoyed skydiving, flying helicopters, horse-riding and waterskiing. Maclean was married to Emma. The couple has two sons Alejandro and Eduardo.
He died on 17 August 2010, when his plane crashed into the ground, while performing a manoeuvre during a training exercise in Casarrubios del Monte, Spain.
