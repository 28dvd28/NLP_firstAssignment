Magnesium glycinate, also known as magnesium diglycinate or magnesium bisglycinate, is the magnesium salt of glycine (one magnesium and two glycine molecules), and is sold as a dietary supplement. It contains 14.1% elemental magnesium by mass. Accordingly, 141 mg of elemental magnesium is contained in 1000 mg of magnesium glycinate.
Magnesium glycinate is also often "buffered" with magnesium oxide but it is also available in its pure non-buffered magnesium glycinate form.

Uses
Magnesium glycinate has been studied with applicability to patients with a bowel resection or pregnancy-induced leg cramps. Less scientific research exists on magnesium glycinate  in theraputic applications than other more common forms of magnesium salt such as magnesium chloride, oxide or citrate. Magnesium glycinate has been considered in the context of magnesiumâ€™s potential influence on systems associated with the development of depression.
