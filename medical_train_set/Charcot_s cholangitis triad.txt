Charcot's cholangitis triad is the combination of jaundice; fever, usually with rigors; and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. It occurs as a result of ascending cholangitis (an infection of the bile duct in the liver). When the presentation also includes low blood pressure and mental status changes, it is known as Reynolds' pentad. It is named for Jean-Martin Charcot.
