Delanterone (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name) (developmental code name GBR-21162), also known as 1Î±-methylandrosta-4,16-dien-3-one, is a steroidal antiandrogen described as an anti-acne agent which was never marketed. The compound showed poor efficacy as an antiandrogen in vivo in animals, suggestive of low activity or a short terminal half-life, and likely in relation to this was not further developed. It was described and characterized in the literature in 1977.
