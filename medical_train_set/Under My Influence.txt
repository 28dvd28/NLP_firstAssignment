Reception
Under My Influence received mostly positive reviews from critics noted at review aggregator Metacritic. It has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on four reviews. In Clash Magazine, Zoya Raza-Sheikh rated this album a 5 out of 10, characterizing it as "a bold undertaking" that "at times... feels unfinished", writing that it "erratically comes together offering a patchwork collection of songs that don’t quite compliment on another". The Line of Best Fit's Eloise Bulmer also praises the band for experimenting with their sound, but writes that a "shorter tracklist would have strengthened the album" and "it's easy to imagine this album being seen as transitionary in hindsight". Writing for Paste, Candace McDuffie rated Under My Influence an 8.6 out of 10, stating that it "encapsulates a unit who have perfected their chemistry so much that they are approaching their prime with precision, passion and grace".
