A drink mix is a processed-food product, designed to mix usually with water to produce a beverage resembling juice, soda, or other sweet products in flavor. Another type of drink mix is represented by products that are mixed into milk. It is traditionally made in powdered form (powdered drink mix), but liquid forms are also seen now.

History
The first juice-type powdered drink mix was Poly Pop, invented by Paul Stevens Hollis in 1922. He sold it as part of the Big State Company until its acquisition by General Foods in 1953.

Ingredients
While some are made with sugar, or sold unsweetened, the products are often made with artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, cyclamates or saccharin, and often include artificial flavors and colors. Powdered drink mixes without sugar will often contain water-soluble filler ingredients such as maltodextrin or dextrose. Some of the products include vitamins or other nutrients.
The products are variously marketed and to the point to children, athletes, bodybuilders, dieters, or as a vitamin supplement. Some brands are only sold as drink mixes, while some beverage companies produce powdered versions of their products, as do Gatorade and Ocean Spray. Another form of drink mix is represented by products mixed into milk, such as malted milk, Nesquik, Ovaltine, and Carnation Instant Breakfast.
