Carabao Dang Energy Drink (Thai: คาราบาวแดง; RTGS: kharabao daeng; "red water buffalo") is a Thai energy drink launched in 2002 by Carabao Tawandang Co Ltd. It is now Thailand's second most popular energy drink. It is the key brand of Carabao Tawandang in Thailand, with an estimated 21 per cent market share in 2014.The name "Carabao Dang" comes from the Carabao Group's association with the band Carabao, combined with the German Tawandang Brewery Restaurant. It is marketed with the slogan "Carabao Dang: The Fighting Spirit".The drink's launch was accompanied by a high-profile TV advertising campaign featuring the company founder (along with Sathien Setthasit), rock star Yuenyong Opakul, also known as Aed Carabao. This campaign was investigated by the Office of the Consumer Protection Board for being too violent, but went on to win a gold and a silver medal at Media & Marketing magazine's Asian Brand Marketing Effectiveness Awards in 2003. A second ad, featuring clips of late actor Denholm Elliott, digitally altered so he was drinking Carabao from a trough, was less successful.
In 2004 the drink was introduced to Europe and the United States. Exports to China and India began in 2007. Carabao was introduced in Australia at the beginning of 2018.
