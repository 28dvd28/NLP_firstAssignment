Health effects and benefits

The primary benefit of gummy supplements over their counterparts, however, is their imitation of candy, providing a pleasant taste and easy-to-consume nature, which appeals to many children and adults who may not like swallowing pills.

Criticisms and adverse effects
Although marketed to the general population, research suggests that most people who eat a balanced diet do not need to take vitamin or mineral supplements.Often the appealing taste of gummy supplements comes from added sugars, which may lead to excessive sugar consumption, linked to obesity, heart disease and dental cavities. Due to this, increasing sugar-free options now exist, however these can often contain sugar alcohols, which can lead to diarrhea or nausea.Many gummy supplements contain artificial food colorings, which have been linked in some studies to behavioral issues in children.Due to their nature replicating candy, they may be susceptible to overconsumption, particularly in children, which may lead to vitamin or mineral toxicity.In the United States, gummy supplements are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as a food, meaning less rigorous research and testing is required than medicines. The FDA does not have the authority to approve supplements for safety and effectiveness, or to approve their labeling, before being sold to the public.Due to the necessity to contain other ingredients for taste, texture and color, gummy supplements can have lower amounts of the active ingredient than traditional methods.
