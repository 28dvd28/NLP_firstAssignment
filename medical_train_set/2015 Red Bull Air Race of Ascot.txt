The 2015 Red Bull Air Race of Ascot was the fifth round of the 2015 Red Bull Air Race World Championship season, the tenth season of the Red Bull Air Race World Championship. The event was held at the Ascot Racecourse in the United Kingdom.
Championship leader Paul Bonhomme took his third victory of the 2015 season, as he was the only pilot of the four finalists to set a time without recording any penalties. He finished 2.6 seconds clear of Matt Hall, with Yoshihide Muroya completing the podium. In the Challenger class, Petr Kopfstein took his second win, 1.144 seconds ahead of Cristian Bolton. Daniel Ryfa had finished quickest, but was given a two-second penalty, and therefore dropped to third.
