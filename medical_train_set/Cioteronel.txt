Cioteronel (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name) (developmental code name CPC-10997; former tentative brand names Cyoctol, X-Andron) is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) that was never marketed. It was under development between 1989 and 2001 for the topical treatment of androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness), and acne and for the oral treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia; it reached phase III clinical trials for acne and phase II studies for androgenetic alopecia, but was ultimately discontinued due to poor efficacy.
