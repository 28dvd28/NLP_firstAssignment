Personal life and death
Silvina Luna was born in Rosario on 21 June, 1980. She started her professional life as a model and promoter. She reached national fame in 2001 when she participated in Big Brother Argentina, where she ended up in second place. After her reality appearance, she continued studying theater. She participated in many plays such as El champán las pone mimosas, Más que amigos, Abracadabra and Explosivos. She also appeared in TV shows such as  Los Roldán and Casados con hijos. She was a participant in other reality shows such as the Argentinian version of Dancing with the stars in 2006, 2007 and 2017.
In July 2014, Luna was hospitalized with kidney stones. She blamed the problem on her cosmetic surgeon, Anibal Lotocki, whom she said used methacrylate on her buttocks. Luna had two cosmetic surgeries in 2011, both performed by Lotocki. After these surgical procedures, she started to have health problems and after several studies, it was discovered that she had high levels of calcium in her blood, which later was confirmed to be a consequence of methacrylate poisoning. Three years later, in 2015, she was on dialysis from 2016 up until her death. The cause of kidney failure is not very clear but appears to have been an autoimmune condition like adjuvant-induced autoimmune syndrome (ASIA) due to methacrylate.
On 31 August 2023, Luna died after spending 79 days in hospital on life support. She had been admitted to the hospital on 13 July 2023. Luna had been awaiting a kidney transplant, which could not be performed due to various infections she had contracted in the weeks and days leading up to her death.
