SPINA-GR is a calculated biomarker for insulin sensitivity. It represents insulin receptor gain.

How to determine GR
The index is derived from a mathematical model of insulin-glucose homeostasis. For diagnostic purposes, it is calculated from fasting insulin and glucose concentrations with:

Clinical significance
Validity
Compared to healthy volunteers, SPINA-GR is significantly reduced in persons with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus, and it correlates with the M value in glucose clamp studies, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold and (better than HOMA-IR and QUICKI) with the two-hour value in oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), glucose rise in OGTT, waist-to-hip ratio, body fat content (measured via DXA) and the HbA1c fraction.

Pathophysiological implications
In lean subjects it is significantly higher than in a population with obese persons.
