The Waterlow score (or  Waterlow scale) gives an estimated risk for the development of a pressure sore in a given patient. The tool was developed in 1985 by clinical nurse teacher Judy Waterlow.  It is available both on a two-sided score card and on an app.

Scoring criteria
The following areas are assessed for each patient and assigned a point value.

Build/weight for height
Skin type/visual risk areas
Sex and age
Malnutrition Screening Tool
Continence
Mobility
Additional points in special risk categories are assigned to selected patients.

Tissue malnutrition
Neurological deficit
Major surgery or traumaPotential scores range from 1 to 64. A total Waterlow score ≥10 indicates risk for pressure ulcer. A high risk score is ≥15. A very high risk exists at scores ≥20. The reverse side of the Waterlow card lists examples of preventive aids and interventions.

Criticism
While packaged conveniently as a laminated card, the score has received criticism owing to its large number of scored items. This, combined with a lack of operational definitions, may reduce its reliability.
