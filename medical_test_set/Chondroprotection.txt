A chondroprotective compound is a specific compound or chemical that delays progressive joint space narrowing characteristic of arthritis and improves the biomechanics of articular joints by protecting chondrocytes. These agents perform various functions, such as:

Stimulating chondrocyte synthesis of collagen and proteoglycans
Enhancing synoviocyte production of hyaluronan
Inhibiting cartilage degradation
Preventing fibrin formation in the vasculatureChondroprotective agents can include both endogenous and synthetic chemicals.  Endogenous molecules include hyaluronic acid, glucosamine, and chondroitin sulfate.
