Reception
Critical reception
Paula Bustamante from Bitácora de Cine favorably criticizes the film's story, which becomes very crude, but there are moments very well achieved for acid humor, managing to move the viewer. Ana Catalina Castillo from Culturizarte highlights the film's ability to make the viewer identify with the main character, although it can become overexplanatory at times. Carolina Benavente from El Agente Cine wrote: "(Im)patient is suggestive and accomplished, serious and playful at the same time, with few potholes that betray a kind of craftsmanship linked to what has already been described."
