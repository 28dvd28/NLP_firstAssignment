SPINA-GBeta is a calculated biomarker for pancreatic beta cell function. It represents the maximum amount of insulin that beta cells can produce per time-unit (e.g. in one second).

How to determine GBeta
The index is derived from a mathematical model of insulin-glucose homeostasis. For diagnostic purposes, it is calculated from fasting insulin and glucose concentrations with:

    {\displaystyle {\widehat {G}}_{\beta }={\frac {[I](\infty )({D}_{\beta }+\left[G\right](\infty ))}{{G}_{3}[G](\infty )}}}
  .[I](∞): Fasting Insulin plasma concentration (μU/mL)
[G](∞): Fasting blood glucose concentration (mg/dL)Dβ: EC50 for glucose at beta cells (7 mmol/L)G3: Parameter for pharmacokinetics (58,8 s/L)

Validity
SPINA-GBeta significantly correlates with the M value in glucose clamp studies and (better than HOMA-Beta) with the two-hour value in oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), glucose rise in OGTT, subscapular skinfold, truncal fat content and the HbA1c fraction.It has the additional advantage that it circumvents the HOMA-blind zone, which renders the calculation of HOMA-Beta impossible if the fasting glucose concentration is 3.5 mmol/L (63 mg/dL) or below. Unlike HOMA-Beta, SPINA-Beta can be sensibly calculated in the whole range of measurements.
