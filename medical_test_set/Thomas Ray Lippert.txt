Thomas Ray Lippert (1950–1999) was a convict and former business law professor at Southwest State College in Marshall, Minnesota. Lippert worked at a fertility clinic named Reproductive Medical Technologies Inc. in Utah from 1988 to the mid 1990s where he reportedly replaced customers' semen with his own. In 1974–1975 he was arrested and later convicted for kidnapping.
