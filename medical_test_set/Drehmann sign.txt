The Drehmann sign describes a clinical test of examining orthopedic patients and is widely used in the functional check of the hip joint. 
It was first described by Gustav Drehmann (Breslau, 1869â€“1932).The Drehmann sign is positive if an unavoidable passive external rotation of the hip occurs when performing a hip flexion. In addition, an internal rotation of the respective hip joint is either not possible or accompanied by pain when forcefully induced.The positive Drehmann sign is a typical clinical feature in slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), the impingement syndrome of the acetabulum-hip,  or in osteoarthritis of the hip joint.
