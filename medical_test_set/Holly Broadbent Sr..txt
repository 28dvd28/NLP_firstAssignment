During the 1933 World Fair in Chicago Broadbent displayed the results of his study of facial development which he took from a series of cephalometric records that he took from his patients.

Orthodontics
Broadbent has been credited with developing the cephalometer along with Dr. Wingate Todd during 1920s. The Cephalometer held a patient's head steady during an x-ray. They published a paper in 1931 called A new X-ray Technique and Its Application to Orthodontia which introduced a technique. This longitudinal study which consisted of cephalometric measurements had 3500 school children aging from birth to adulthood.
He also established a reference point on the skull called Bolton Point.
