According to a false conspiracy theory, medbeds (an abbreviation of "medical bed" or "meditation bed") are secret beds that can miraculously heal humans and extend life. The plausibility of such devices is pseudoscience.Medbed conspiracy theories often involve claims that the devices are utilized by members of a 'deep state' and billionaires and that the former President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, is still alive, lying on a medbed. Belief in these devices is popular among QAnon influencers such as Michael Protzman, Romana Didulo, and YamatoQ.Various companies sell devices or access to beds that supposedly heal ailments via imaginary technologies while also including fine print on their websites disclaiming that no diagnoses, treatment, or cures are provided.
