Brian Deegan  (born May 9, 1974) is an American professional freestyle motocross rider and racing driver.

A co-founder of the Metal Mulisha clothing line, Deegan is one of the most recognizable names in action sports. He earned 10 XG medals in Moto X, before he made the transition to four wheels. In 2010, Deegan earned double silver in Racing and RallyCross. In 2011, he took RallyCross gold and came back to earn bronze in 2012.

Racing career
Deegan became a pro supercross rider with Team Moto XXX at age 17. In 1997 at the LA Coliseum, Deegan won the 125cc main and ghost rode his bike across the finish line. This was the beginning of what we know today as Freestyle Motocross.
In 2004, at the Winter X Games, Deegan crashed while attempting a twisting backflip 360 over a 100 ft (30 m) snow double, breaking his femur and both wrists. He came back 6 months later to place fourth at the Summer X Games.
Switching to four wheels in 2009, Deegan ventured into short course off-road racing in the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series' Unlimited Lites division. He ultimately won the championship over more experienced off-road drivers.At the 2010 X Games, Deegan competed in the Rally Car event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He finished second behind Tanner Foust after making a wrong turn during the race. He also competed in Rally Car Super Rally, again finishing second behind Tanner Foust.

In 2011, he won the World Championship race at Crandon International Off-Road Raceway in the Traxxas TORC Series. He also won the Pro Lite Unlimited and Pro 2 class championships in the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series. In addition, he represented the U.S. with teammate Travis Pastrana in the Race of Champions (ROC) competition held in Germany. ROC is an international competition that  invites top drivers from around the world to compete in a series of different racing events.
In 2012, he debuted the Metal Mulisha Monster truck. Todd LeDuc officially debuted it at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas in January 2012. Deegan drove the truck in Phoenix, Arizona at Chase Field. Deegan also won his second championship in the Pro 2 class of the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series.
Deegan raced an OlsbergsMSE Ford Fiesta in the Global RallyCross Championship, earning runner-up in 2012, fourth in 2013 and 12th in 2014. He also continued his Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series career, winning the Pro Light Unlimited championship in 2013 and the Pro 2 championship in 2014. In 2015, Deegan was hired by Chip Ganassi Racing to compete in seven Global Rallycross Championship races in an M-Sport Fiesta along with former professional motocross rider Jeff Ward.

Media appearances
During a 2005 taping of MTV's Viva La Bam, Deegan under-rotated a back-flip and suffered a strong impact from the handle bars in his midsection, almost losing his life. He lost a kidney, lacerated his spleen, and lost a significant amount of blood. He now has a long scar down his stomach, that he calls his "zipper", spanning almost his entire abdomen, as a result of the accident. At the end of the episode when it originally aired, Bam dedicated it to Brian. The accident was cut out of the show.
In 2006, Deegan and Berkela films released a film entitled Disposable Hero that follows him through the struggles and rewards that accompany the freestyle motocross sport and lifestyle. Jesse James, Ronnie Faisst, Jeremy Stenberg, Cameron Steele, Chris Ackerman, Nate Adams, and Seth Enslow are a few of the featured cast that talk about Deegan and his life's journeys.
