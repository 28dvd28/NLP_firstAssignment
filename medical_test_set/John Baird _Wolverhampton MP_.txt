In parliament he took an interest in health and social insurance issues. He was a strong opponent of racism, and also sought to form better relations with Communist countries, visiting the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China on a number of occasions.According to John Callaghan, Baird should be "counted as the first Trotskyist MP" for assistance he gave to the second Revolutionary Socialist League, later better known as Militant.  Pierre Frank commented that he "was always on our side."Baird died in a London hospital in 1965, aged 58.
