The Red Bull Road Rage is an extreme downhill on-road bike competition. The competition was first held in 2005 as a pro-invite only event, but since 2008 Red Bull has opened it up to amateur and professional racers. Red Bull Road Rage has seen editions held once in each Italy, France, Germany, Belgium, Latvia, Israel, Poland and Bosnia & Herzegovina and twice in Switzerland and the USA.
The event is similar to Four-cross mountain biking but also call as bull rase. An initial individual time trial ITT qualifying and seeding run is held, followed by the top 32 competitors racing four at a time in knock-out heats, with the two fastest progressing to the next round.

History
The roots of Red Bull Road Rage can be traced back to Jon Mesko of Giant Bicycles, who came up with the idea in 2001. He contacted the Red Bull (North America) Communications Manager, Paul Melina, in 2004 to pitch the idea and in January 2005, Red Bull gave the green light to commence organising the event.
