Dental practice
Chase is reported to be the first woman accepted as a full member of the American Dental Association and as the only woman dentist in St. Louis, Missouri in the 1890s. However, there were actually other female dentists practicing in St. Louis at the time the article was written.

She graduated from Iowa State University dental school in 1889 and used the distinction D.D.S.  The same article provided information on the appearance of the Chase household that also included the doctor's practice: "the walls were covered with the work of Mrs. Chase's late husband."
