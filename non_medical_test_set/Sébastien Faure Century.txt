The Sébastien Faure Century was the French/Italian contingent of the Durruti Column during the Spanish Civil War, named for the anarchist of the same name. It formed the First Century of the International Group, and consisted of about fifty members from France, Italy, and other countries. Initially started by French nationals who had gone to Spain to help fight the Fascists, the group soon merged with Italian nationals and others, including the Algerian Sail Mohamed.
