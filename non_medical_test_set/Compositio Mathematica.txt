Early history
The journal was established by L. E. J. Brouwer in response to his dismissal from Mathematische Annalen in 1928. An announcement of the new journal was made in a 1934 issue of the American Mathematical Monthly. In 1940, the publication of the journal was suspended due to the German occupation of the Netherlands.
