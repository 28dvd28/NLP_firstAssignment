Tor Åge Bringsværd (born 16 November 1939 in Skien, Norway) is an author, playwright, editor and translator. He is perhaps best known for his speculative fiction. Together with long-time partner Jon Bing, he is also considered the first Norwegian author to write science fiction literature. Bringsværd regards himself as an anarchist, which is clearly reflected in some of his works. He is also known for his distinctive style of writing, for example for his seemingly random jumps to narratives or anecdotes with no clear relationship to the main story.
