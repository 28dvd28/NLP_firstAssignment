History
It was built on a demolished convent and chapel of Reformed Augustinians, which explains why it is commonly known as "Les Réformés" despite being a Roman Catholic church. The church building itself was designed by the architect François Reybaud and the abbey Joseph-Guillaume Pougnet, and built from 1855 to 1886. It is neogothic, with ogival curbs in the ceiling. The architects took inspiration from the Reims Cathedral and the Amiens Cathedral. The two arrows are 70 metre high.
The bronze gates were designed by Caras-Latour, the high altar was designed by Jules Cantini (1826-1916), and the stained windows were designed by Édouard Didron (1836-1902). Additionally, sculptor Louis Botinelly (1883-1962) designed the statues of Joan of Arc and of Jesus. As for the organ pipes, they were made by Joseph Merklin (1819–1905).In the 1980s, due to low attendance, it came under the threat of being demolished. However, in recent years, it has achieved record levels of mass attendance.

At present
The church building is open every day from 09.00 to 12.00 and from 13.00 to 16.30, except on Sundays. Mass is every weekday at 18.30. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday it is also celebrated at 12:10.
