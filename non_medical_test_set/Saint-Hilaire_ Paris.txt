History
An original oratory was built on the site in the 11th century. The site is located on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève on a plot that belonged to the canons of Saint-Marcel.In 1158, the building was attested as a parish chapel dedicated to Saint Hilary. The small parish had numerous bookshops —up to 14 on Rue Saint-Hilaire in 1571.During the French Revolution, the church was closed in 1790 and the parish was suppressed in 1793. It was sold as a national good in 1796 and demolished in 1807.

Architecture
A drawing of the church shows that the bell tower was made of carpentry with no masonry.

Ruins

They can be seen in a small courtyard that can be reached from 1bis Rue de Lanneau near the corner of the Rue Vallette.
