The Pro-Cathedral of the Holy Trinity (French: Pro-cathédrale de la Sainte-Trinité; Dutch: Prokathedraal van de Heilige Drievuldigheid) is an Anglican Pro-Cathedral in Ixelles, a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. It is part of the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England. The church is located at 29, rue Capitaine Crespel/Kapitein Crespelstraat, near the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan.

Origins
The Pro-Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Brussels was formed in 1958 by the amalgamation of the congregations of Christ Church and the nearby Church of the Resurrection (now closed). It is a Pro-Cathedral for the Diocese in Europe. The cathedral is in Gibraltar, called the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity (and there is a further pro-cathedral in Valletta), but Robert Innes, Bishop in Europe (and former Chancellor (priest-in-charge) of Holy Trinity), is the first bishop to be based in Brussels.
