Louis Pierre Goullaud (23 November 1840 – 7 December 1919) published and sold music in Boston, Massachusetts, in the 19th century. In the 1860s he worked for "Koppitz, Pruefer & Co." With Asa Warren White (1826–1894) and his son, Edward Warren White (1849–1896) – as the firm "White & Goullaud" – he sold musical instruments and published sheet music (c. 1869 – 1875). Under his own imprint he issued sheet music and Goullaud's Monthly Journal of Music. He retired c. 1886, and died in Braintree on December 7, 1919.
