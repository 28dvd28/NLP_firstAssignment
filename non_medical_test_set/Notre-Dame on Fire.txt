Synopsis
On 15 April 2019, a violent fire broke out in Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Men and women will do everything to save the building and the religious and art treasures stored within.

Cast
Production
In April 2020, Jean-Jacques Annaud announced that he wanted to make a film about the fire. He explained this choice later: "Obviously, I immediately felt the extraordinary cinematographic merits. Beyond the disaster and the grief, of course, there is precisely the emotion and the spectacle of the fire". The filmmaker had first thought of making a documentary.Filming began in March 2021 in Bourges. Bourges Cathedral was used for its resemblance to Notre-Dame. The team then began to shoot in the studio at the Cité du Cinéma. A sequence was then shot in mid-April in Versailles, in the Versailles-Château-Rive-Gauche12 station. Sequences were also shot in Amiens Cathedral, whose spire and certain parts of the building are similar to those of Notre-Dame.The scenes recounting the start of the fire were set in the 13th-century framework of Saint-Étienne cathedral in Sens. In this place, shots were also taken on the forecourt, on the stairs of the towers, and in the nave.To complete his film, director Annaud called for the recovery of archive footage from the day of the fire:
"I still need the traffic jams that were created by this event, the people singing in the night to cheer on the firefighters who saved the cathedral. I also need testimonies from foreign countries (…) to discuss the planetary event. If you have these images, we would be happy to take advantage of them and put them in the film."

Release
In February 2022, it was announced that the film would be released in France on March 16, 2022 by Pathé, three years after the fire.  It was then released in Italy on March 28, 2022 by Vision Distribution. It also was released on July 22, 2022 in the United Kingdom by Pathé's British distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures.
