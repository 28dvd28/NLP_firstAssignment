François Le Levé (1882-1945), was born in Locmiquélic, Morbihan. Militant anarcho-syndicalist. Le Levé was one of fifteen anarchists who signed The Manifesto of the Sixteen, along with Peter Kropotkin, Jean Grave and others, favoring the Allies during World War I. (Overwhelmingly, anarchists refused to take sides, opposing the killing in favor of class war; see, for example, Errico Malatesta.)
A member of the French Resistance during World War II, Le Leve was captured and interned. He died while traveling home after being liberated.
