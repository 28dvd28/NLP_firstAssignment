Henri Félix Camille Beaulieu (known as Henri Beylie; 30 November 1870 – 1944) was a French accountant, naturist, anti-militarist, anarchist and then communist. He wrote many articles in radical journals. In his later years he was active in the Committee of Social Defence (CDS), an organization that helped political prisoners and exiles.

Early years
Henri Félix Camille Beaulieu was born in Paris on 30 November 1870. His parents were Charles Beaulieu and Jeanne Beylie. a seamstress.
At a young age, he was a non-commissioned officer in the African Battalions, but was dismissed for "collective revolt and protest".
On returning to the metropolis, he mixed in libertarian circles in Montmartre and began to publish articles in La Revue Libertaire (1893–94).
After anarchists staged several attacks in Paris in 1893, there was a wave of arrests.
In January 1894, Beylie, Henri Gauche and Henri Guerin were arrested questioned by a judge.
Gauche and Guerin were the editors of La revue libertaire (Paris, December 1893 – February 1894).
The three briefly took refuge in Brussels, Belgium.

Naturist anarchist
After his return to France, Henri Beaulieu worked as a plumber for the Northern Railway, then in 1895, he became a bank employee.
He participated in "naturist" libertarian groups led by Henri Zisly and Jules Bariol in Paris.
Between July 1894 and February 1898 Beaulieu, Émile Gravelle and Henri Zisly published four numbers of L'État Naturel which advocated naturism, vegetarianism and veganism.
Between 1895 and 1898 the three men published the monthly La Nouvelle Humanité, which proclaimed that humans would be released from slavery through a healthy diet and outdoors living.
Writing under the pseudonym Henri Beylie, he contributed to various other libertarian publications.
He was in contact with the paper Tribune Libre published in Charleroi, Pennsylvania by French miners who had emigrated to the US.On 10 September 1898, Beylie married Clémentine Bontoux and found work as an accountant.
The naturist group was dissolved in 1898, and he joined the fight to defend Alfred Dreyfus.
In the summer of 1899, Beylie left this cause, dissatisfied with the way that Sébastien Faure was handling the case.
He continued to contribute to various anarchist publications.
In 1901, another naturist group was formed, and from June to October 1901 Beylie edited Le Bulletin de l'Harmonie.
In 1901, he also contributed to the Cercle d’études sociales  (Circle of Social Studies: CES) in Paris.
In February 1902, the naturist group dissolved due to disagreement between those such as Beylie and Zisly who thought it was necessary to make a radical break by retiring from the world, and those who thought the excesses of urban civilization could be moderated without sacrificing the benefits of progress.In 1902, Beylie and Georges Butaud co-founded the "milieu libre" anarchist society, with the goal of "creating and developing a free environment in France".
Early in 1903, this gave rise to the Milieu Libre de Vaux (Free Commune of Vaux) located in  Essômes-sur-Marne, Picardy. G. Butaud was the facilitator.
From November 1903, the anarchist colony was the target of an attack some libertarian journalists, and the 5–12 December 1903 issue of Le Libertaire published a negative report on the colony.
Beylie and Butaud answered in the colony's monthly bulletin of December 1903, giving a positive report of ten months of communism.
However, in February 1907, the experiment came to an end.

Beylie was secretary-treasurer of the league. In 1903, he published the brochure Le militarisme. Ses causes, ses conséquences, les moyens de le combattre.
Beylie was a member of the First of May society, whose members were arrested on the night of 29 April 1906 when they were putting up a poster in the street of Paris called the Manifeste abstentionniste et antimilitariste, and were accused of anarchist propaganda. They were later pardoned.
