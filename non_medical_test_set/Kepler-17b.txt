Kepler-17b is a planet in the orbit of star Kepler-17, first observed by the Kepler spacecraft observatory in 2011. Kepler-17b is a gas giant nearly 2.45 times the mass of Jupiter, and is sometimes described as a "super-Jupiter".
The planet is likely to be tidally locked to the parent star. In 2015, the planetary nightside temperature was estimated to be equal to 2229+50−58 K.The study in 2012, utilizing a Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, have determined the planetary orbit is probably aligned with the equatorial plane of the star, misalignment equal to 0±15°.
