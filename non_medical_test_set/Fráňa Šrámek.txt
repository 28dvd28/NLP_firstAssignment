Fráňa Šrámek (January 19, 1877, Sobotka – July 1, 1952, Prague) was a Czech impressionist and vitalist poet, novelist, playwright and anarchist.
In 1885 his family relocated to Písek, where he lived for a long time and much of his work was created in and about this town. After study he joined the military for a period of about a year, but was forced to continue service for another due to bad behavior. In 1914 he fell seriously ill.
