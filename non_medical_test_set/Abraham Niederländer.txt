Abraham ben Ephraim Niederländer (Hebrew: אַבְרָהָם בֶּן אֶפְרַיִם נידרלנדר), also known as Abraham Sofer and the Sofer of Prague, was a sixteenth-century Jewish-Austrian mathematician.
The scribe of Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, Niederländer also published Brit Avraham (1609), a work on arithmetic based largely on Elijah Mizrachi's Sefer ha-Mispar as well as non-Jewish works on mathematics.
