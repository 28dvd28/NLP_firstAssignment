Hinduism in Telangana encompasses a diverse range of traditions, practices, and beliefs. Although there is considerable variation, certain elements exist that unite the Hindus in the state. These include the worshiping of a pantheon of gods and goddesses, engagement in yoga and meditation, and the celebration of festivals such as Diwali and Holi.
The historical legacy of Hinduism in Telangana is both extensive and vibrant. The region was a religious and cultural hub in the past, as it was home to the Satavahana Empire. Later, during the 17th century, the Qutb Shahi dynasty governed the area and constructed numerous mosques and Islamic structures. Nonetheless, Hinduism retained its dominant position as the prevailing religion in the region.
Hinduism is the dominant religion in Telangana, with over 85% of the population identifying as Hindu. The state is home to several important Hindu pilgrimage sites, including the Yadadri temple, the Bhadrachalam temple, and the Ramappa temple.

Cultural Identity
Hinduism influences the language, literature, arts, music, dance, and festivals (such as Bonalu) of the people of Telangana. Epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and ancient scriptures such as the Vedas and Upanishads form the culture's foundation. Hinduism has significantly influenced Telangana's cultural, religious, social, and philosophical identities and has deeply rooted itself within the Telangana peoples' way of life.
