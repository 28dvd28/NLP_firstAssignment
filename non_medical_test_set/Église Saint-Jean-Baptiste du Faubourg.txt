The church was built on an old church building. It was designed by architect Laurent Vallon (1652-1724), and built from 1697 to 1702. Its construction was partly funded by a donation from Jean-Baptiste Duchaine, a canon in Aix. The building itself is shaped like a Greek cross. It was expanded in the nineteenth century.Inside the church, the altar dates back to the eighteenth century. Additionally, the pulpit inside the church was designed by Jean-Baptiste Rambot. A painting by Charles de La Fosse (1636-1716) was donated to the church in 1821. There are also two paintings by Michel Serre (1658–1733).Painter Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) married Hortense Fiquet in this church.
