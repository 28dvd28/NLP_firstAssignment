History
After the death of Bishop Similien 17 June 310, his successor, Eumilius, erected over his grave a votive chapel.
One hundred years later, the bishop Leo, a Greek (444-458) built a real church 20 meters long and 9 meters wide which is also called "Holy Sambin". It ends east exedra by a narrow apse of 4 meters in diameter. The building, which then dominates the "Bourgneuf", built in square stones interspersed with brick chaining, will be dedicated on 24 June 419, day of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist. It also has the oldest baptismal fonts of Nantes (fifth century).
At the end of the fifth century, Gregory of Tours designated the church as the Basilica antistis Similini, in his De gloria Martyrum saying was dedicated to Saint-Donatien.
