Ralph Samuels (born December 1, 1961) is a businessman and a member of the Republican Party and candidate for Governor of Alaska,  that served as a state representative of the Alaska State Legislature from 2002 to 2008 representing House District 29 and serving as the majority leader.

Educational background
Attended schools in Anchorage, King Salmon, and Fairbanks and graduated from Metlaktla High School in 1979.  He attended the University of Alaska, in Fairbanks from 1980 to 1985.

Positions as a gubernatorial candidate
Economy- One of the main planks for Samuels' candidacies, he claims, is to encourage economic development. In a recent article he was quoted saying, "As governor I'll work to encourage economic development. We'll look at the current tax structures to determine whether or not there's an opportunity to stem the recent rapid decline in oil production and oil exploration in Alaska,"
Energy- In March 2007, when the Governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin presented the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA) to build a natural gas pipeline from the state's North Slope (with $500 million seed money from the state), Samuels was the only legislator who voted against the measure.
Taxes- He also was in a coalition that opposed the, then Governor Palin introduced, tax raise known as "ACES" (Alaskans Clear and Equitable Share)which made Alaska as the highest marginal tax rate in the world."
Family- In January, Samuels wrote a position statement in support of the initiative circulating the state attempting to re-instate parental/legal guardian notification of a minor to receive an abortion. In his article he claimed "...in our society that a parent must consent before a child gets her ears pierced or even receives an aspirin at school. The notion that a non-emergency medical procedure can be performed on a teenager, without a parent even knowing about it, strikes most people as absurd. Yet this is exactly what happens in Alaska."
