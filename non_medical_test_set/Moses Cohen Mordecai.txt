Career
Mordecai owned the Mordecai Steamship Line, which he used to import fruit, sugar, tobacco, and coffee. Additionally, he was a co-owner of the Southern Standard, a newspaper published in South Carolina from 1851 to 1858. At the same time, he served as a member of the South Carolina Senate. His votes reflected his opposition to secession in the 1850s, prior to the American Civil War of 1861–1865. He used his newspaper to echo this position. Moreover, he was widely seen as a politician representing the merchant class and free trade.According to author Robert N. Rosen, Mordecai became "the most prominent Jewish Charlestonian of the 1850s and 1860s." He served as the parnass, or chief administrative officer, of the Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim, a synagogue in Charleston. Overall, he did not suffer from much open antisemitism; however, historians have noted that Senator James Henry Hammond (1807–1864) privately called him a "miserable Jew" in his diary.During the American Civil War of 1861–1865, Mordecai decided to change his mind about secession and supported the Confederate States of America. Some of his ships were used by the Confederate States Navy. For example, the Isabel, named in honor of his wife, was used to remove Major Robert Anderson (1805–1871) from Fort Sumter at the Battle of Fort Sumter on April 14, 1861. In the aftermath of the Civil War, and after his shipping enterprise had been shattered and he became blind, he moved to Baltimore, Maryland.Mordecai was a slave owner.
