Kepler-445 is a red dwarf star located 401 light-years (123 parsecs) away in the constellation Cygnus. It hosts three known exoplanets, discovered by the transit method using data from the Kepler space telescope and confirmed in 2015. None of the planets orbit within the habitable zone.

Planetary system
Kepler-445b, c, and d orbit Kepler-445 every 3, 5, and 8 days, and have equilibrium temperatures of 401 K (128 Â°C; 262 Â°F), 341 K (68 Â°C; 154 Â°F), and 305 K (32 Â°C; 89 Â°F), respectively. With a radius of 2.72 times that of Earth, Kepler-445c is likely a mini-Neptune with a volatile-rich composition, and has been compared to GJ 1214 b. Kepler-445d is only slightly larger than the Earth, with a radius of 1.33 RðŸœ¨.
