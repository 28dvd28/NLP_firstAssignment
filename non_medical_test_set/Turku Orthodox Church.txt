Turku Orthodox Church (Finnish: Turun ortodoksinen kirkko, Swedish: Åbo ortodoxa kyrka) or the Church of the Holy Martyr Empress Alexandra (Finnish: Pyhän marttyyrikeisarinna Aleksandran kirkko; Swedish: Heliga martyrkejsarinnan Aleksandras kyrka; Greek: Η Ορθόδοξη εκκλησία της Αγίας Αλεξάνδρας είναι ανοιχτή, I Orthódoxi ekklisía tis Avías Alexándras ínai anikhtí) is the main church of the Turku Orthodox parish located at the northwest corner of the Turku Market Square along the Yliopistonkatu street in Turku, Finland. The church was built under plans drafted by architect Carl Ludvig Engel and was ordered by Nicholas I of Russia on 5 January 1838. Construction, which began in 1839, cost 67,886 rubles and was completed in 1845. The church was consecrated on 2 September 1845. The church was dedicated to Alexandra, the spouse of Diocletian who had publicly become Christianised and suffered a martyr's death on 23 April 303. The choice of patron saint may have been due to Nicholas I's wife's name, Aleksandra Feodorovna.
Most of the icons of the iconostasis come from Valaam Monastery.
The Turku Orthodox church cemetery and cemetery chapel are located in Vasaramäki and there are other parish sanctuaries in Rauma and Salo.
